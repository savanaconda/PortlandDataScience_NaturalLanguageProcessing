0,Fun social deduction exercise that gets merrier the more players participate. The game significantly benefits from each added player. Experienced players are going to have an edge through knowing the characters and hermit deck and that's a bit problematic. The first time players especially suffer from not being able to read the behaviour of the neutral players.,True

4,"2014-01-28  Initial rating: 8.5 (January 2014)  As expected, Caverna is a great GREAT game. It is very reminiscent of Agricola (of course) but when the game was explained to me, I was surprised how different it was. I was expecting a very similar game but Caverna has a lot of new things, enough add-ons that, for me, the game feels very different than Agricola and this is very positive in my book! It now comes with Dogs!! Love the dogs and I´m also happy that they don’t provide any food :D. I couldn´t eat my dog to avoid starvation anyway. I like the new scoring system, instead of having limits you always will win a VP if you have more vegetables, cows, donkeys, etc.  The game components are awesome, except for the disappointing start player token. It is out of place with such high quality components. The game box is big and is filled with bits. I also dig the new fantasy theme. Agricola`s was very boring.  On the bad side, I feel Caverna is a little less tense than Agricola, it has an imitation action space that (practically) guarantees that you will have the needed action available on your turn. Also, I’m not sure I would want to play with 6 or 7 players. Even with 5 it can be a long game. I’m open to try this exactly once to see how the games flows, with 7 players the game can be very tigh (I guess) but I feel the downtime would be excessive. Also I think Caverna has a lot less replayability than Agricola, The cards were replaced by tiles and over time the game can get samey as there are few tiles (compared with the amount of cards in Agricola). The expedition actions are very powerful, a player can feed his family with this kind of actions alone. For some reason, I don’t like this part of the game as much as the whole. I think if a player skip totally the expeditions, he will lose the game, making them a dominant strategy.   In the night board there are some features that are hard to see.  Bottom line, Caverna is a great game. I think it is a bit better than Agricola, but it doesn’t replace the game for me, so I think I will have both of them in my collection :D. For now I’m only worried about the replayability factor in Caverna and I won’t say no to a game. Great game, I totally recommend it.   Current Rating: 8.5 [hr] 2014-02-17  After more plays, I think I don’t like the expeditions because they feel (a little) overpowered and have no thematic sense. How can I go to an expedition and furnish a room? Also how can my weapon get better with time? It should be like Robinson Crusoe, each time I use my weapon, it should degrade.  Still, these concerns are very minor and I still love Caverna.  Current Rating: 8.5 [hr] 2014-05-26  After even more plays, I’m getting a bit bored. I have lost a game when I had 5 family members and the winning player only had 2, but they were level 14 dwarf who only went to expeditions x 4. This alone made him win the game. The expeditions are overpowered as they effectively give you up to 4 actions with a single dwarf. Every player who has ignored the expeditions has lost in our games. This is THE dominant strategy.   There is almost no tension in the game, you don’t have to worry (much) about losing an space to an opponent, there are repeat spaces and the imitation one that allows you to get what you want when you want it. In the feeding phase you can exchange everything for food. I miss Agricola’s tension.  Also the game is very samey every time I play it. I miss Agricola´s cards (variability).   I retract myself and now I think Agricola is the superior game by a lot.   I enjoy Caverna but now I don’t think I will buy it.   Current Rating: 7.0 [hr] 2015-02-20  Nowadays I almost never want to play a Caverna game, It is a good game but it feels very samey each play and it has low tension. Agricola is the better game for me so I don’t think I will be playing much Caverna in the near future, instead I still need to play lots of decks  I have bought for Agricola.   I’m glad I didn’t acquire it.  Current Rating: 6.0 [hr] 2016-02-01  My current desire to play Caverna is very low, due to this I’m downgrading its rating to one I feel is deserved by the game. For me, Caverna is an average/mediocre game. I got tired of it with very few plays while I have played Agricola around 80 times and I still want to play it. Caverna´s static setup practically guarantees there is a dominant strategy, also it lacks a lot of tension which is why I love Agricola. Perhaps the only superior thing Caverna has over Agricola is how the family members are scored, perhaps 3 points per family member is too much, but you can add this rule to Agricola easily and without any pain.  I will do my best to stay away from this game, and I’m eagerly awaiting the new edition of Agricola.  Current Rating: 5.0  [b]Jgoyes´ Awards: [/b]  [imageid=2863524inline]",True
5,"The game is meh... what I dislike is that the numerous options don't seem to differ too much... at any point you will have numerous options available, but all seem to be equally good.

7,"Very similar to, but a surprisingly big improvement over Union Pacific. The main difference is that everything is limited by a tight money supply and you lose an action to take more. The routes are more open, it's unlikely that you'll be completely boxed in, even with five players. Still some luck-of-the-draw in the shares that come off the stock, but the bonus shares are more difficult to obtain this time. A much tighter game all round than UP.",True

9,Awesome party game if you like betting. Its a trivia game where you dont really need to know the answer. You can always just guess who of your opponents knows the correct answer. I would give it a better rating if the questions weren't so localised.  ,True
10,"Felt unnecessarily complex at first, but after a round or two, everything becomes clear.   You kind of have to relish in the game's many moving parts, or it won't be enjoyable.   I was reminded of Hansa Teutonica, in that each player has a number of pieces on their individual board that they are trying to get onto the main map (i.e. it is a ""dashboard"" game).  A variety of wood bits represent the different building types, which functions essentially as a tech tree.   The catch is that you can only build on your own color, so you must ""terraform"" a hex to match your color first.   The game aims to have theme by providing 14 different fantasy races to play, each with different costs or special abilities, but I'd say the theme is almost non-existent apart from a few nods in the racial abilities.   It has as much theme as Kingdom Builder, for example.   The only part of the game that felt a little flat to me mechanically was the 4 color tracks that players are racing to be first in.   This has been done in many other games and didn't add much here.   But, by and large, for a heavier, thinky-er Euro, this is an engaging and interesting game throughout its length.   Has gotten better with age.",True
11,"Pretty neat.  Kind of reminds me of Through the Desert mixed with Settlers of Catan!  You're generally trying to place ""trails"" of your pieces across the board, but must use resources in able to build those pieces.  The luck of the draw, while fairly minimal, makes it fun and interesting for me, as dealing with the order in which your buildings come off the stacks is the gist of the game. ",True
12,"Another great little game from M. Merkle. It has numerous subtle little strategies that become apparent very quickly indeed. Very smooth and satisfying. [EDIT] Problems that arise is some games (not terribly often) are due not to problems in design fundamentals, but rather luck in tile draws. Occasional luck issues are better than shoddy design.",True
13,"If there ever was a game where the civilization theme was pasted on this is it. Just forget the theme as this game is a 100% abstract. Still it is a very good abstract game. It has a good mix af strategy and tactics, leaning more to the strategical side. Also the quick play and relatively easy rules make it a game you can pull out at he end of a gaming session if you have 45 minutes left. Despite the easy rules it's still a game with great depth.

18,"Has climbed in the ratings for me. It really is a clever, fun little game, and a good challenge for the brain without being a brain burner. Hard choices and the ability to play different strategies and still be competitive make this a good game. There's a combination of buildings that will work for you if you can find it, based upon what your opponents are doing and what you've done up to any point. The game starts out by players usually looking to get some sort of income stream going, but with the money being added to unused roles and other opportunities coming early, this doesn't fall into that category of game where predictably each player has to build an income engine before they switch over to earning victory points. That's one of the strengths of the game - there's great variety and many ways to approach it. Top stuff.",True
19,"Not game #1 for me but being #1 on the Geek 8 years after its release certainly is enough proof of lasting goodness. The unique point is that even after this long time there are no big numbers of me-too-products like El Grande or Caylus have produced. The role selection and tight gameplay still feel fresh and good play needs concentration on various dimensions like strategic planning, efficient engine building, timing of roles and control of the game end. Compared to today's (2010) eurogames it shines in its comparably streamlined rules creating a fluent gameplay without much downtime. Agricola is fiddly as hell in comparison. Too much love for chrome and aimless complexity today. Troyes anybody? That being said, Puerto Rico is a design that I respect rather than admire.",True

21,"Still easily the holy grail of CCGs (at least of those I've tried). I don't care for the collectible aspect (anymore) which means you really need to have opponents with approximately the same investment since more money often means better cards (although to be fair Magic handles card rarities much better than many other CCGs). Playing with fixed decks isn't all that great, either, since deck-building amounts to a lot of fun all by itself.

30,"Players have 2-sided tokens with numbers adding up to 7. Each round, players take turns moving one of their unmoved tokens, then flipping the token over. Can interact with board elements sort of like RoboRally. Next, Furunkulus moves: flip movement card over, which determines either # victims (1 or 2) or # spaces to move. Moves step by step straight ahead, then turns towards closest player to L/R/Front (if tied, keep going straight). Continues moving till kills specified #victims or moves specified #steps. Killed tokens returned to player till part 2 of game, when they're removed from play. Part 2 starts when penultimate monster movement token is revealed (shuffle monster movement cards).   Advanced rules add some extras.  Light fun. Have only played a few times, but don't feel the need to own it. Seems too chaotic -- would rather play RoboRally, although this is shorter.",True
31,Basically a neat themed race game with a cool monster mechanic where it is uncertain where and how far he will move and whether he will kill or only move.    Very light so it plays like a filler but it is longer than a filler should be. There is some thinking as a subtle move could thwart some opponents and catch them off guard making a fun little screwage factor. I see someone suggesting a timer to force you to play even faster and I can see why that might be even more fun. ,True

36,"Isle of Skye is a quick tile laying game. Every round (there are only six) you get some income, then draw three tiles. One of those tiles you'll discard. The other two you'll price by putting some of your coins next to them indicating the cost. Then, in turn order every player gets to buy a single tile from someone else. They pay you the price you set and you take their coins and the coins you put next to that tile. After everyone has purchased a single tile (or chosen not to), you have to buy any tiles in front of you that weren't bought, by giving up the coins you set next to them. Then everyone places their tiles in their tableau.  Every game will have 4 different random goals that reward for completing certain configurations of tiles, or for various features on those tiles. Not every goal will be scored every round though. Each goal will be scored three times during the game, but the order of scoring varies (which is preset and known at the game outset).  Pricing tiles correctly is hugely important. If you try to price tiles expensively, you may not be able to buy anyone else's tiles... and other people may let you have your expensive tiles, which will bankrupt you for next turn. But price them too low and you'll give away points. You can be screwed and end up with no tiles to place, if you couldn't afford to buy a tile and everyone bought the tiles you had to offer, but you'll be set up for the following round with a lot of cash.  The game is fairly straightforward, and there's nothing truly revolutionary here, but it's quick and fun.",True

Each player owns their own, go out into the black, look for jobs, misbehave, get paid.  Helps if you know the show/film and like it.

The only downside is that it seems that there are a few idiosyncrasies that may initially turn people off, but being taught by an experienced player or reading some information on the game should fix that.

44,"Players are opposing Mages, duelling in an arena.  Large, lavish game where mages alternate taking actions.  Actions can be ""full"" - slow, powerful actions, or ""fast"" - quick actions which also allow movement before the action.  The battle takes place on a huge 4x3 square area.  Actions typically involve casting spells, prepared from a ""spell book"" (basically a CCG card display folder).  Spells come in six or seven categories - attacks, conjugations, creatures, enchantments, and so on.  Mages cast their spells, build up, summon help, and basically go to battle.  Combat is a clean, dice based vs armour affair.  I was quite impressed by this one.  Obviously a lot of thought and development has gone into it, and care taken to get it ""right"".  It plays very well, looks good, and is well supported by an excellent set of rules.  My only concern is the playing time, which may blow out depending on play style.

It's the only game where it took like 30 minutes to setup (build the decks), and that was even with following the instructions for the pre-build decks rather than building our own. And then the game took like 5 hours to play, maybe 4 with some downtime removed. But it is a [b]very[/b] rich experience.

48,"A lot of depth here and quite interesting for anyone interested in this genre as there will be plenty of new character expansions. You're a mage (d'uh) with your own spell book that you flip through each turn and pick two spells to play. There are quick spells and long-casting spells and you can do one of each per turn though you have to sacrifice moving to do a long-casting one. The spells are of all different types: defensive, offensive, creatures, enchantments, conjurations, etc. They provide an incredible amount of asymmetry and variability in what you can do. Each character is different (wizard, beast master, etc.) and has a different spell book. And flipping through the spell book to choose what to play gives a great sense of control which was refreshingly different than the usual card game fare.   The game does seem like a commitment to a system rather than just a buy once and play type of game. You should probably go in expecting to buy further characters and spell books, but assuming you like the game, that's a feature not a flaw. You'll need to find a partner willing to invest in the time to become familiar with the game or else you'll crush everyone and nobody will want to play with you.

The game is basically a riff on Magic the Gathering, the twist being that every spell in your deck is available to you at all times. Combat also has a spatial aspect, as the game takes place over multiple zones in which your mage and summoned creatures are free to roam. Think Summoner Wars, but with far more intricate play. Overall, I'd say the game has a lot of potential. There are aspects of it that I wish were a bit less complicated, but as I mentioned before, the game is still in development.

There is certainly strategy and even some tactics involved for sure, probably enough for your average gamer.  However, I really enjoy deeper games and this game isn't ideal for me. That's NOT to say this is a bad game or even an average game, it's certainly well designed and it seem quite balanced.

Because it's meant to be frenetic corridor killing action, it's thematically correct to limit the amount of communication teams can have, but you can do some clever things if you move / action in the right order. Sometimes. Usually it's obvious what to do with your powers so there's little sense of key decision making, ie that you're dramatically influencing the result with your decisions. The end-game condition belatedly appears and it can be easy or ridiculously hard depending on how things have gone to date, so there's another random blow on top of all the random die-rolling which characterises success or failure throughout.

152,"Vladda has released another masterpiece. I have no idea how he continues to put out game after game that completely breaks the mold of traditional designs, but he continues to innovate in every game genre he tackles. Here he has created a fantasy adventure game in the vein of Runebound or Talisman but with a deck building mechanism that turns the usual character growth system on its ear. The game is also ridiculously complicated, yet the rules are so intuitive that it really isn't hard to keep them straight. Even the little exceptions that spring up from time to time are so logically presented that it is fairly easy to remember them without even opening up the rulebook.  My only real criticism is that I could do without the Mage Knight license. The game was clearly NOT designed around the old miniatures game, as the story presented in the game's introduction has almost nothing to do with what has come before in Mage Knight fiction. The day and night mechanics as well as the concept of mana to drive spell casting are also completely alien to the Mage Knight setting. It smells like a retro-fit and I'm still not completely sold on that aspect of it. Tying the game to that license seems a little counter-intuitive, especially when the game does such a nice job of separating itself from every other fantasy game on the market. Hopefully the Mage Knight tie-in doesn't limit it's appeal to fans of heavier games, because this one has what it takes to be an all-time great.      ",True
153,"This was so close to being good that it breaks my heart. I recently got the WoW board game, and was really impressed by how good it was, so I thought I'd give Starcraft a try. It is indeed a good game, but I can see why it hasn't been reprinted after all this time.  One thing Starcraft does very well is being an epic game of moving dudes around a map and attacking each other. The rules are incredibly simple despite the thick rulebook. In many ways, the structure of the game reminds me of Star Wars: Rebellion. There is a lot of programming actions followed by carrying them out, but this game utilizes a deck-building mechanism for technology and combat cards. The combat is really simple as well, and this may be the first game that utilizes card combat in a way that I enjoy. Also, the way you use your workers it simple, yet effective. The core engine of this game works really well.  Unfortunately, the game does not feel enough like Starcraft to me.  All the units, races, technologies, etc. are here, but ultimately the game doesn't really translate these well into the game. All the units are very similar, with some technologies helping to differentiate them slightly. Despite the designers trying to capture the theme, it felt like the miniatures were put into this game to sell the game rather than to be utilized as important components. For the most part, units are either ground units, air units, or support units. Beyond that, there are very, very minor differences that don't really differentiate these units from each other.  Along with that, territories are won and lost very quickly. I get that this game is trying to zoom out from a single skirmish to a more abstracted, universal view of what is going on, but it doesn't give me the same feel as playing the PC game. You aren't so much building up bases and chipping away at your opponent as you are expanding on a map and attacking opponents occasionally.  I don't know. It's difficult to put into words why this game doesn't translate the feel of the PC game that well, but it just doesn't for me. The WoW board game really gave me the feel of growing and expanding my character, but this game didn't feel like a game of building a base and sending troops at my opponent. As I mentioned before, Star Wars: Rebellion covers a lot of the same ground, but even more than that, I feel like Nexus Ops captures the feel of playing Starcraft more than this game does. I thought this game was fine, but it's not one I think I'll ever seek out that often.",True
154,"2013-11-20  Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2012)  I’m a huge StarCraft fan, so when I played the game I was severely disappointed. It was too long for what it offered and I was bored at the end, too much downtime (the worst sin a game can commit). I will give it another chance soon as I bought the game, but I will probably sell it.  The game has great components and art. The minis are gorgeous and the board looks great. It’s been awhile since I last played the game AND perhaps the person who explained it made a lot of mistakes (thus I will play again soon), however I do remember that I didn’t like that you had so little defensive capability, but I liked the “deckbuilding” mechanic.  Bottom line, I will give the game another chance, however for this time/complexity ratio, I would play Twilight Imperium 3rd edition instead of StarCraft. I will comment and rate again after I play it again, for now I feel this is a 5.0 for me, a boring game that I would play from time to time due to its awesome theme.  Current Rating: 5.0 [hr] 2014-11-04  After another play, I enjoyed more the game, but not by much., All my previous comments for the game still hold. Too long for what it offers, lots of downtime, a bit boring. I will try it again with the expansion to see what it changes.  The combat system is ok, but I really miss throwing dice dice in combat.  In theory I should like the game but in practice I'm bored by it.  Current Rating: 5.5 [hr] 2016-11-06  I recently played Forbidden Stars, the StarCraft reimplementation. I’m much more of an Euro player so I didn’t care much about it and I don’t care much about Starcraft either. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating. I already sold both games because my desire to play them again is very low, however, I recognize both games can be great for certain kind of players, but they aren’t for me.  Current Rating: 5.0",True
155,"Pandemic is an awesome game, and one everyone should own! You really have to work together with your team in order to be successful. I've played this solo all the way up to with 4 and its been enjoyable every time. The only two nitpicky things I have to say are to be aware of not letting a player hijack the other players' turns and I wish the game was a little more tense toward the end. Great challenge and a great game!",True
156,"An intriguing design...  Still, it didn't charm me to play it on regular basis plus I see 2 significant problems: - replayability - the best buildings can be identified quickly and good players will always choose from them ignoring the rest.

Even with novices, it seems like the Imperial player has stumbled their way into accidentally winning on multiple occasions. Aside from that, this really is the best Star Wars game on the market.

162,A solid family weight cooperative game with simple mechanics.  You are trying to get treasure off an island before it sinks.  You work together to collects sets of cards and travel to the spot with where you get the treasure.  Once you have the treasure you travel back to Fools Landing and play a helicopter card to leave.  Each player has different abilities and the game will eliminate a lot of tiles quickly.  You must share cards to win.    Very fun and a great family weight game.  ,True
163,"A real surprise for me when I first played it in Essen 2009. I'm not really fond of the western theme but with this game it really works. In this game you are settling a town in the west. It is a nice worker placement game with a lot of direct player interaction. Something that is missing in so many games. There is quite a bit of luck involved but with the tile variant you can take most of it out if it bothers you. Your limited workers (cowboys) force you to make tough decisions. Not the least of these is to go for vp's early when they are cheap (but you won't have a lot of money), or go for them later and get a much worse exchange rate.

The ""intermission"" basically amounts to a second reading of the rules (every time you play!). The second half, depending on which mission you are randomly running, may or may not have clear goals. The win and loss conditions are still likely a mystery and you stumble about the house swinging wildly while the super powerful traitor and, at times, the house itself, continually knocks you down.

You need the FAQ for almost every scenario -- this is unforgivable.

175,"This, the archetypal American big box game is yet another multi-player conflict affair in which the best strategy is to 'turtle'. There's certainly no shortage of ambition in the design. This is an empire building game which incorporates conflict, trade, diplomatic and technological elements. You'd hardly expect a game this big to be balanced, fair or free from chaos and sure enough it isn't. The random setup can give far more opportunities to some as the tiles are not equally valuable, similarly the strategy choices will see the Imperial and Initiative tiles taken first with the rest a mediocre option. It also has the usual arbitrary player attacks, luck of cards and dice and the possibility of kingmaking. In spite of all the above, there's still a good chance of having fun. Nothing is too 'thinky' so you can relax and chuckle at others' misfortune during the inevitable downtime. Although the game takes 6+ hours, time will pass quickly. In the end though you'll find it strange that more of the problems haven't been ironed out over three editions and realise that Tempus is the same game (even down to similar problems) in a quarter, or less, of the playing time.",True

Understanding that pattern makes the reasons for war become more clear. Players start to anticipate when a nation is going to cash in on its holdings, or when a nation's controller is about to cash out the treasury. Once everyone at the table connects those dots, the game becomes a pressure cooker as you try to skim as much money as possible without setting up your opponents to do the same.

185,"About [thing=1198][/thing]:  [b]1) What is it?[/b] [thing=1198][/thing] is a simple card game about pattern recognition - in the same vein as that in Spot It!, but a little harder. The goal is to find more patterns (each one found gives one point) and win the game.  [thing=1198][/thing] is a game about speed in perception and is interactive in the sense that everyone is trying to be faster than the others, but there isn't a way to directly affect someone. It is totally abstract, without presence of luck (if there is ""lucky"" drawing, it serves everyone) and with some hidden information due to the draw deck.  [thing=1198][/thing] makes for a good game when you want a light option, one in which no one will have to worry about tatics or strategy nor make plans - it is just about looking and seeking patterns. This means that [thing=1198][/thing] can have value in develope or sharp aptitute in pattern recognition).  The production value of the edition I have is weak: the box is flimsy, the sheet for the rules does its job, and the card are serviciable. Replay value is high, as the random nature of the draw makes for different patterns to notice - still, the feel of the game is mostly the same.  [b]2) How do you play?[/b] Basically: there are four parameters in each card - shape, color, filling and quantity. To form a set a person has to use 3 cards in which every parameter, individualy, is either [i]all the same[/i] or [i]all different[/i].  There will be 12 open cards. However says ""Set"" first gets a few seconds to point to the three cards that forms a set - if the person is right, she takes the three cards, keeping one (for scoring) and discarding the other two, then three new cards will be drawn and added to the table. If the person is wrong, she will lose one point, and play will proceed normally.  Once the deck is over and there isn't more ways to make sets, the game is over. The person with the most points will be the winner!  [b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b] Only when say ""Set"". Is barely a decision, but it is - I say this because, if you see a set, there is no reason not to say ""Set"" and take the cards. However, if you go too fast and are wrong, losing a point not only harms, but also your mistake gives more time for the others to look for sets.  [b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b] - Portable and easy to carry around; - Language independent; - Plays fast and has constant tension; - Few rules, making teaching and learning them rather quick; - Can work well for a big range of ages.  [b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b] - Production value, while not bad, is lacking; - The pacing is uneven: sometimes the play is tense and lively, and in others, is silent, boring and appears almost comes to a halt.  [b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b] Learning that finding patterns isn't as exciting as Sherlock Holmes, Batman, Robert Langdom, Jeff Goldblum and others lead you to believe. It is usually a dull task - and the reason why [thing=1198][/thing], [thing=63268][/thing], [thing=8098][/thing] and others add rules to make them a race, a matter of quickness in the eye/hand/mouth coordination. [thing=1198][/thing] is a litle more complex due to its four parameters, which can induce to more mistakes and calls for more caution - usually not a good thing when we are talking about naturally boring task made better by being a fast real-time game.  Overall, [thing=1198][/thing] wasn't as enjoyable as others in the genre - it doesn't have big flaws or problems, but also doesn't reach greatness. [thing=1198][/thing] ended up being a little boring, with a sizeable part of the play coming down to staring at the cards in the table, in silence. I would play it again, as it is easy to get into it and the playing time is short enough - but when one of your main reason to play a game is because ""is short"", you know it doesn't fit your tastes very well.",True
186,"Wow. This is an impressive mix of worker-placement and medium-weight railroading. Not an economic game, income comes in the form of points, and the scores can run VERY high by game's end. This scratches two of my favorite itches in one box and I look forward to keeping this and playing it quite a bit.   There are some fresh mechanics here that are not that difficult to grasp. In most railroad games you upgrade your engines and extend your railroad. This abstracts the extension part and puts the focus on upgrading. You upgrade not only locomotives, but also track and industrialization - and you can get specialty engineers that give you unique actions you can perform. I do think that both railroaders and pure eurogamers will find a lot here to enjoy. My rating could easily rise to a 9....",True

It's an interesting scoretrack progression mechanism, having to spend actions to push the lower scoring markers along to make room for each successively higher scoring marker.

Plus the variable actions that the game introduces each round, but which can also be ""won"" for your personal use. In fact, there's lots of things to like. Not so great is that the theme is non-existent ... it really is a pure Euro worker placement game designed to force you to specialise so as to maximise your points and hope that other people leave you the actions you want to maximise that strategy (ie do what others aren't!).

Additionally I own the 1995 AH version with the ""Power Tiles"" which I feel completely unbalances the game. Obviously AH thought so too as this is the only edition with the stupid tiles. This edition had a nice look to it though with the lovely board printed wonderfully. Thrift store find for $0.49. Condition was new...the game had never been played all stock cards had HARD/SHARP corners and were still stuck together. However it was w/o shrink wrap and the box suffered water damage and split corners.   I just got my copy of the 2008 edition as I love the look of it.

209,"Players create four shuffled stacks of tiles and each turn can draw two from any stack or build tiles that were previously placed on their player boards. When you draw, you can place directly to the main board or, if you can't afford the cost or want to wait, you can play it to your player board. The main board consists of tiles that consist of 7 build spaces, three of which depict resources. The number of starting tiles depends on the number of players. Every tile has a cost in resources to build which can be paid by a combination of playing in proximity to the resources on the board and by cards played from your hand. However, the player boards depict groupings of buildings with a relational flow. If you can build adjacent to an already constructed building that is previously connected by the depicted flow, you can build it for free. A key piece to getting ahead in this game is arranging your tile draws to take advantage of as many free builds as possible. The first player to connect two temples (which start on opposite sides) or place all of their tiles wins.  The tile draws create a fair amount of randomness and it is possible for a good shuffle to make it relatively easy to build a lot of free buildings, which would be tough to beat. For the most part, though, this is a game about assessing the best move each time you draw and is very tactical. It is enjoyable.

210,"Knizia is such a prolific designer that it is hard to describe a game as ""one of Knizia's finest"", yet that is often how I feel about Amun-Re.   In this game the key mechanism that is repeated throughout, in multiple places and ways is the payment of money in forced steps: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc. Each raised bid costs exponentially more than what the current bidder has to pay that it makes it a tough propisition to properly evaluate the value of a property.  Then you move to buying resources. There are three kinds: Cards, Farmers, and Stones. Each of them cost more and more the more of them you buy. Again, it makes evaluating your purchases difficult, as you want to make sure your investments payoff in money or victory points. Deliciously tense money management.  Finally, there is the blind-bidding for extra resources, known as the offering. You have a choice here: Steal money and lose a resource, offer just one gold and get one resource, or offer more and try for 2 or 3 resources. It gets very difficult to determine the optimal offering as you have to try to guess what each opponent will do and how that will affect what you should offer. Finally, the mechanism of rewarding the farmers (and on scoring rounds, the temples) based on the value of the total offering, can really throw those calculations out of whack.  There is so much going on that the game could have become a brain-burner, but there never seems to be a problem with that in the games I am in.

This game is an excellent mix of theme, originality, El Grande, and Caylus. The game plays like a slugfest, punch after punch, which can be fun with the right group.  Raising it to an 8 of 10.   Third Play, June 2012, Comment: Greater appreciation for the many layers and complexity of game play.  Raising it to a 9.  Fourth Play, June 2012, Comment: First 5 player game, not as good as with 4. Later rounds of game can be decided by 1-3 card plays, and thus, players need to take their time on these moves.  If they don't play very carefully, game outcome becomes a bit randomized, calling into question why the preceding 3 hours of game play were even played. Seems like a slight flaw.  Lowering to an 8.   Twelfth Play, August 2012, Comment: Okay, whatever faults it has, and there are some, this is just an incredibly interesting game to play and consider from a design perspective.  Back to a 9.  A few thoughts for those players who find the game too long, chaotic, or vicious, with too many options for king making.  Because these complaints are essentially directly linked to the cards and card effects, and some in our group, have these issues....to improve the game for our group, we typically take out the three extra action pawn cards (which lengthen the game), and if we are in the mood to diminish the nastiness, we also take out the Blight and Catastrophe cards, or perhaps 2 other semi-nasty ones.  This tends to dial down all of the aforementioned problems.  In sum, with card selection/reduction options, this game is VERY customizable, something that you should understand straight up.  Have problems with some of the cards?  Take them out.  The game can stand on its own merits, without playing with ALL the cards.  Enjoy the version you make.",True
219,"Players represent a captain running a ship around the Caribbean.  They can be nice and lawful, trying to eek a living from honest merchant trade, or turn pirate and aim for fast wealth.  Lavish, lovely looking game.  Players take turns to take three actions - sail, scout or port.  Sailing is simply moving, but may barge into trouble from the navies of the world.  Scouting is how to find merchants and such.  Port actions involve honest trade, refit and upgrades to your ships.  Nice, playable game that is very reminiscent of Avalon Hill's Blackbeard (about 10 similar mechanics/ideas, but it is a coincidence, apparently).  A four player game, each racing to 10 glory points, is going to take a long time, and the action is interrupted too often by the long port actions of the players, as well as a laborious multi-step combat system.  I can see the appeal, but Avalon Hill's Blackbeard's blindingly fast action/turns, and tense uncertainty, make that game so much more appealing, and it's faster and more historical too.  This one feels like a 15 year old game that missed the flute with modern, interactive game mechanics.  Two plays were enough to convince me.",True

Then you decided to go to the toilet and chase the badger out of its hole. And when you get back it is still not your turn.  Merchants and Marauders could have been a fun pick up and deliver game but it would have required the game being stripped all unnecessary fluff like the rumors, glory cards, zillions of ship attributes, and most importantly the over complicated and long battle would have needed simplifying. Now a single battle could take 15 minutes and all the while players not involved in the battle have nothing to do.  Mechanically there is nothing broken and there are no fatal design errors. The whole game just feels like all the mechanics were taken from a board game published 40 years ago. There is nothing innovative or elegant. Everything is slow and clunky.

I have so many problems with this one, but, frankly, it's not worth my time to explain.

The theme really could have been far more appealing as generic humans versus monsters, and I find the whole Hell Dorado mythos detracts as a backdrop - it is unfamiliar and opaque to most of us and I find players just ignore rather than embrace it. A worse decision, however, is having two pairs of human characters use identical sculpts and be differentiated only by one member in each pair having blonde hair. Truly is a bad decision for the ages. The game itself is good enough that it overcomes its absurd theme and other poor choices on the part of the publisher. Again, a dungeon-crawl game with relatively few rules, a short play time and tense, balanced action is a rare bird, and Claustrophobia gets high marks in all those areas.",True

There is also a pawn that could stand in your way, and you can't place a selection token in the same spot as a previously placed one.

It seems like the Rebels rack up wins pretty quickly, and then at the end of the campaign they lose. I feel like this should have been reversed to feel more thematic, but it does make for an exciting conclusion to each campaign. The skirmish mode is pretty fun, but also feels inferior to games like Battlelore.  UPDATE: Eventually degenerated into yet another game of comparing attack dice to defense dice.

Both games are basically the same rules-wise: - You can play a card or discard a card; - You can only play an Untimely Death as your first card (not counting for Events and special abilities that bend this rule); - You can play a second card or discard a second card; - You can pass; - You draw cards from the deck until you are back to your hand limit; - And most important of all: all the cards played must be backed by a story, connecting the family member your are playing it on with the name/situation of the card itself.  [thing=12692][/thing] is a storytelling game first and foremost. Sure, it has a winner, and yes, one can play only to win. But, for me, this is secondary. The story told is what matters.  And it is because of the story that I like [thing=12692][/thing] better than [thing=18723][/thing] or [thing=1234][/thing]. One of the reasons is because, of course, the dark humor.

You can actually make an understandable story for your characters - sure, there are interferences and swings in some of them, this is a game, after all, and it is part of the fun, since this unexpected changes require thinking on the part of the players: to use them to their benefits, somehow.  In [thing=1234][/thing] I never feel I had any sort of control: I just try to take the story from point A to and weird-ass point B so that I can connect it with my cards in hand.

Each era's cards are placed in a display of alternating face up/down cards, in a different pattern each era. Players alternate taking them, so you have some planning based on a little foreknowledge.

Actually I think that the switching between the app and the physical components detracts from, and not adds to, the experience. So, as a boardgame I find it lacking.

It feels like your choices will matter, though going for cities (extra dice) early seems obvious and likely a must do strategy so it takes a little of that away.  (getting guys is too powerful?)  I was surprised too how much the theme actually came out, you kind of have the tech tree effect there, you have to feed, etc.  Luck is not that big a factor I found either, for a dice game, you do get 2 rerolls if you need them and there are a couple other little ways to help.

The theme is well-implemented and contributes to my enjoyment. A rare case as usually theme in this type of game is used to cover insubstantial mechanism. Star Wars: Rebellion is different. Decisions matter, clever hand management and an action plan where to assign leaders each round are of importance.

274,"2016-08-29  Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2016)  I was a fan of Star Wars right up until the last movie (The Force Awakens which I despise but that’s other topic :D) but I still have fond memories of the books, the PC game and previous movies. Besides, Star Wars: Rebellion is a game well regarded here on BGG so I was keen to play it.  As is usual from FFG, the game components are outstanding, the miniatures are very detailed and they look great on the board. The art is very good as well.  The theme is great as I love the original trilogy.  The game´s rules aren’t very complex, but there are many rules. You can explain them under 20 minutes. Both rulebooks seem intimidating at first, but they are far easier to understand than I initially expected. Gameplay is around 3 and a half hours.  The decisions needed to play the game aren’t trivial, but aren’t that hard either. As the Empire you have to move your armies through the galaxy looking for the Rebel base. As the Rebel player you have to hide your base as best as you can. Both players have to decide which mission to accomplish and whose leaders to assign (or oppose) to each mission (that’s the best part of the game). I also enjoy the cat and mouse dynamics between the factions. The Galactic Empire is very powerful military wise while the Rebel Alliance has very meager resources. In my game, the Rebel Alliance didn’t win a lot of combats but almost win the game nonetheless. Combat isn’t as important as I initially thought. Star Wars: Rebellion is a deception game.  The feeling of playing and controlling both Death Stars is amazing!, it has an epic feel to it :D.  Combat is ok and easy to understand. There is some luck with the dice, but most of the time the expected result happens, that is, I don’t feel the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck, you can prepare for it. There is much more uncontrollable luck with the cards (missions, projects, tactics).  To me, Star Wars: Rebellion is only a two player game, with more players the game slows down and the downtime increases to unmanageable levels.   On the bad side, from my very limited perspective, it seems winning with the Rebel Alliance is much easier than with the Galactic Empire due to a mission card that the rebel player always has at hand (the one that lets him move his base to 4 or up to 8 different systems if you use two leaders). I need more plays to verify this claim, but if true, that could hamper my desire to play the game many times. It seems playing with the Empire requires a lot of finesse while playing with the Rebel alliance is easy and straightforward. I like asymmetric games, but so far, it seems to me both factions aren’t balanced. I need more plays to see if this is an issue for me or not. The rebel victory doesn’t feel very thematic, they can get away with lots of mistakes and, as moving the ships through the galaxy is so slow, time is on their side.  Bottom line, Star Wars: Rebellion is a good Ameritrash game. These days I no longer enjoy that genre as much as before but I enjoyed the game. For now, it is a borderline 7.0 to me and I have not yet decided if I should keep it in my game collection or not. I need more plays to see if the rebels can escape as easily as they did in our game. I want to play it again soon. Much better than War of the Ring though.  Current Rating: 7.0",True

I understand the desire to have players keep (or upgrade, not replace) their starters, however it's a little clunky.  This is a very minor nit and won't really affect game play.  ",True

Little control.  Poor get poorer. Not much ""game"" to speak of. Worst of all because there is so little to actually do after building the ship, it's rather boring.  The more I think about it the more I dislike Galaxy Trucker.

290,"This is the decent blend of AT and Euro mechanisms. I say this because on one hand you can try for area majority/VP and can co-exist with certain of your opponents units without resulting in combat. Each god can try for completing objectives for various benefits throughout the game as well as an instant Victory. Direct conflict can also be advantageous through your units/cards. Finding the right mixture of strategy and tactics based on what your opponents are doing is key for victory.  The asymmetrical powers of the four gods are fun to explore.  What makes this an interesting design is that it's a wonderful blend of euro area control with ameritrash combat and ccg-esque card abilities.  Every game has it's flaws. If I was to pick one with this game is that it can be very chaotic. This shouldn't surprise you as the word is part of the games name. No matter how well a person plays, you may not have a chance in winning based on the player induced chaos and potential kingmaking.  While the 4 gods seems to be mostly balanced with one another, in the base game anyway, there are some upgrade cards for each god that are better than others which leads to a bit less choice in the game.  Other things to mention is that there is an action point system in place which I like, dice is used to resolve combat which is ok, and it will not be a 3 hour affair like some other FFG games which is awesome. The visual design and components are heavily themed (and sadly, not very functional at all), though some may be turned off by the theme.   This used to be one of my favorite games, but it's fallen out of favor due to a very disappointing expansion, some points I haven't mentioned and, various reasons I outline here:  https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/9780933#9780933",True

295,"This is a standard auction game with one pretty unique feature that really elevates it and makes you think differently about the game than most others.  In this players will bid to win auctions of regions at the start of each round.  The regions will provide many different benefits from income, to farmers that will increase income based on that round's harvest, to building blocks for building pyramids, to special action cards that give players additional abilities.  After each player has won an area they spend money to buy stuff.  Either farmers, action cards, or building blocks.  Everything except the building blocks is limited by the region(s) they own.  The building blocks are arguably the most important from a scoring perspective though as once you buy three for an area it becomes a pyramid and those are worth the most points.  The really unique feature for this game though is that after 3 rounds the board gets scrubbed...almost.  Everything disappears, including players ownership of regions, except the pyramids which stand the test of time.  So for the second half of the game when regions show up at auction you may be bidding on an area where there are already some pyramids built and like I said those are worth the most points.  This creates a really interesting dynamic.  Every pyramid you build in the first half of the game could go to another player or not even show up at auction at all during the second half.  Not to mention the rest of the game is decent too, it doesn't do a whole lot new, at least not for 2015 (this game was originally released 12 years ago), but is a more standard auction/economic game.  It's this neat changing of ages that really makes it stand out.",True

297,"About [thing=205059][/thing]:  [b]1) What is it?[/b] [thing=205059][/thing] is the follow-up to [thing=83330][/thing], and it remains a game of horror, mystery and investigation in a very personal and small frame: usually a mansion or a manor. But it has two major changes: it is fully cooperative (well, at least for the majority of the time) and is app-driven.  The full cooperative and app-driven changes made possible for [thing=205059][/thing] be a good option for solo play, while in the first edition, this would only work in a few scenarios - none in the base game.  And it also made possible for the game to retain the mystery aspect of uncovering clues and unfold an investigation without the need of getting everything ready and in the proper place ahead of the time, and took out the drama of one mistake making the whole play impossible to finish, which is a major bummer when we are talking about a 2-5 hours game. This all means the game comes with a lot less cards (no more Keeper cards nor combat), and the set up is basically sorting some decks and tokens, picking investigators and scenario and went for it: a 10-15 minutes affair instead of the brutal time the first edition had.  Replay value seems higher, as the app can generate different configurations for the same mystery.   The 2ed kept, however, the quality in art and miniatures, and the box is even bigger than before - most in the count of the Star Spawn miniatures.  [b]2) How do you play?[/b] Much like in the 1st edition. Players will try to solve a mystery by going to a dreadful place. Every person has two actions, and the main actions possible by the investigators are: - move up to 2 spots; - search; - fight; - take items; - trade.  Depending on the action done the app will call for some test. Dice are rolled and they are all d8, with some sides being success (elder sign), possible success (clues) and failure (blank). Player can turn the possible success into full success by spending clues, on a 1 to 1 ratio.  As before, the spells are double-sided, and once used, they can have some unexpected effects. Damage is handled different now: there are, still, Stamina and Sanity, but when either is damaged, players take cards: some will go facedown (just marking damage as if counters) and others face up, having constant ill effects. Is possible that, during the play, sometimes the app will call for the player to turn over one of her damage cards - the effect on the other side will be applied then. This is highly thematic, as old wounds open and come back to hinder again, and passsed traumas surface to make the person relive traumatic experiences.  If an investigators gets insane, the player takes one insanity card, which might add or change the way that investigator will win the scenario, usually giving the investigator something to do, even to the point of becoming a traitor.  Once everyone has had their turn, the Mythos phase come in. Monster will move and attack, if they can, some random or scenario-based events will take place, sanity will be rolled for those facing creatures, and so on.  Then is back to the investigators. Play will continue until the mystery is solved inside the time available, or until things end up in failure.  [b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b] Which action to do. Normally the state of the game will show what is more pressing. Some guesswork might be necessary in order to find the evidences, or spots to be, or what the investigators truly need to do in order to win. But the scenario will provide clues in order to lead the investigators to the objective.  Normally the decisions will be group-based: ""I do this, you do that, she goes there"" and so on. Positioning and proper teamwork will be keys to win, regardless of the scenario.  [b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b] - Great production value, from art, to components and graphics; - Strong thematic experience; - Due to the unknown results of many actions, an alpha player won't have an easy time here; - Set up and tear down aren't big issues, specially considering the ""size"" of the game; - Downtime is less of an issue as it was in 1st edition (specially when considering combat and the Keeper phases); - No more ""I will always be the Keeper"" thing.  [b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b] - Is app-driven (hey, is my opinion and I don't like app in my analogic games); - Replay value, while much less of an issue than before, is, still, an issue; - Less fearful for the investigators than its predecessor.  [b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b] Begrudgingly. I'm not a fan of apps in games. The less they do the more I like. Still, after going with my cane towards the ipad to say for it get out of my lawn, I must admit that the game was enjoyable and I wasn't as bothered as I thought I would. For a game that part A must happen before B and this one before C, otherwise things won't work, a computer program will take care of it better than humans in a hurry of playing already. An app was a good decision - it could be handled some other way? Probably, but the digital do allow for a type of freedom to add and change that the analog simply doesn't.  Now, does the second edition has a weaker parts when compared with the 1st? Yes, a few. The presence of a Keeper means the actions done to the investigators tend to be more focused, as in the 2ed, since the app doesn't take into the consideration the place the investigators are nor which actions was done by who, it means that the occasional event targeting someone happens by chance.  Also, a Keeper brings more tension to the game: the actions of the investigators tend to be done with one eye on the board and the other on the Keeper. ""Will let me move freely? Will he use one of her cards now? What devilry is she planning?"", and so on. As the AI is only activated when ""touched"", several actions are ""safe"" - in most, almost all cooperatives, this isn't an issue, but when you get in a terrible place, in a personal level, one would expect a constant feeling of tension and fear, and in MoM 2ed, this simpy isn't there.  Still, in the end, the 2ed improved the gameplay and easiness to get into the meat of the play. It isn't without flaws nor weak points when compared to the 1st ed, but when considered which one people will be playing more often and won't be scared of actually playing (mainly the Keeper), the 2ed is the clear winner.",True

Though if this one is really good, it will be the last one that I need anyway.  Right?  With its Crisis cards and traitor mechanic, the game is a clear offshoot of Battlestar Galactica, but I imagine that's common knowledge by now.  Thankfully, I think it's a bit shorter than BSG, depending on the scenario.  Criticisms and comments:  Having all players pre-roll their dice speeds up the game and allows for careful planning, but it also drains some of the tension from the game.  My biggest complaint, strangely, is that the flavor text doesn't appear frequently enough, but when it does it tends to be a bit too long. I also wish that players weren't aware of the possible outcomes of their Crossroads decisions, since it's more fun (Arkham Horror style) when decisions lead to unexpected and/or funny results.  That would make Dead of Winter less of a game and more of a story, however.  [i]Update:[/i]  I need to spend more time thinking about DoW, but I'm leaning towards the idea that the system is deeply screwed up. The semi-coop nature of the game, where every player - even the ""good guys"" - has his or her own secret agenda leads to seriously wonky behavior.  I usually find semi-coop games extremely amusing (e.g., Terra, LOTR dice-building game, Gloria Mundi) because truthfully they're social experiments that barely even count as games. The difference between Terra and DoW, though, is that DoW is a lot longer. Watching a game crash and burn after 30 minutes, to me, is pretty darn funny, but I've learned that watching the same thing happen after 2-3 hours is not much fun. Even if I'm the one causing the game to crash.  An interesting point, which has now been debated on BGG at length, is that a ""good"" player who can't win (i.e., their secret goal is essentially beyond reach) can tank the game in such a way that no one wins. Though this only makes sense if that player is convinced that there is no betrayer, since tanking the game otherwise could lead to ""betrayer"" kingmaking.  A valid justification for imploding the game in the face of certain defeat - in my opinion - is that it causes the game to end much more quickly, which in turn allows me play something else with my crazy friends.  I would probably like DoW more (as a game, not experiment) if it were genuinely an ""us vs. betrayer"" coop where, to win as a group, the good guys had to beat the main objective AND all good players had to achieve their secret goals. Though this would lead to all sorts of ""secret information"" problems, since players would simply tell each other what they needed to fulfill their secret (well, not anymore) objectives. Also, for this to work, the game would need to be fine-tuned so that the main objectives were easier to accomplish in the first place.  Anyway, I think there are numerous things that are wrong with DoW (balance, gamey play, general design), but it'll take time for me to sort them out in such a way that I can communicate them clearly.

I don't know if O&L really solves that problem, but I don't feel it as much, and it's a little easier to create generative loops. It's still a little tricky to keep track of all the powers, especially with the tiny little cards, but I really dig the powers, and the spatial aspect of the game is cool, as is the ability to control the size of a player's plot.  Fun.  (3 plays)",True
369,"This game has a lot of good going for it.  I love the resource wheel, it is an innovative, fun, and easy way to handle resource collection and game management.  Absolutely brilliant!  I'm a big fan of worker placement games in general and I love some of the unique ideas in this game, such as the work contract mechanic.  I also, as weird as this sounds, just really like games where the strategy is based on turning stuff into other stuff (my friend calls it Transformer Syndrome).  Not sure why, I know it's weird, but I enjoy it and Ora et Labora is the holy grail for that mechanic.  It also helps that there appears to be multiple paths to  victory you can strive for in this game.  In my first play I only won by 12 points and my strategy was focused on buying the most valuable buildings in the game, many of which I never intended to use while the second place player focused mainly on collecting valuable resources with victory point values.  Two completely different paths to victory and a very small score margin, give or take a turn and I could have lost by a handful of points.  This also creates a game that comes with a lot of replay value out-of-box.  Not on the level of my favorite game, Agricola, but with so many paths to victory you can play a different way every time.  There's a decent variety of buildings that scales from 2-4 players and two completely different settings (France and Ireland) with different buildings and resources.  With all that I know I should love this game but it has some annoying parts that hindered my enjoyment of the game.  First, the masses are right, the quality of the components sucks.  Anybody who says different is fighting an uphill battle to defend this game which as I've said above has a lot of good going for it but the components suck.  Flimsy paper instead of cardboard for the plots is awful.  They curl in the humidity and are too flimsy to handle conveniently.  They slide around the table when building your monastic society and simply look trashy for a game with this kind of pedigree.  The cards are of equally low quality, the pegs for the wheels are not properly sized, and the chits are not properly punched.  I've had worse quality components in other great games and I don't hold it too much against the game but it is a huge disappointment, especially the paper used for the plots.  The other, even worse, gripe I have about this game is the huge amount of cleanup time.  Not only are there millions of chits to pick up and separate into containers (some sort of Plano or otherwise storage solution is REQUIRED  -- it's a grave oversight that the game does not come with some sort of solution of its own -- unless you like rifling through a ton of tiny square double-sided chits every game), but sorting all the cards (which are also double-sided for the two game settings) and plots (which need to be sorted by value) takes a long time and if you don't do it properly you just move the time taken to the next game's setup time.  But I mostly ignore this downside because for the game to exist in its form this is a necessary evil.  It also doesn't help this game's chances that I have other great, and a LOT less fiddly, games that fill the same kind of role.",True

373,"This game took the draft mechanic from Magic the Gathering well before (2004) it was presented to the vast majority of the boardgamers by 7 Wonders... Fairy Tale is a fast and light filler (much faster than 7 Wonders: it can be played in 15 minutes!), that perhaps lacks the variety and replayability of its more notorius descendant, but gives lots of choices and fun in a very small amount of time.",True
374,"As I wrote in my mini review of Among the Stars, I have found that I like drafting games, so this one should be right up my alley. While there were some neat ideas and the gameplay was decent, it wasn’t that funny.   One thing which needs to be mentioned when comparing Fairy Tale to 7 Wonders or Among the Stars, is that you don't pick a card, pass the others on and then reveal your cards. So you draft all of your cards before you choose which ones to play, so you have several options, and every time you pass cards on to other players you cannot be sure what their strategy will be, and you might forgot just exactly which cards you passed on to the player in an earlier round (if you pass a lot of the cards on which multiply in value depending on their number, you're going to lose)!   However, I must confess that I find some of the cards much better than the rest; those which give you 7-8 points seem like a no-brainer as they aren’t that difficult to fulfill. I did like how you need to react to the cards in the other players’ tableaus which make you “hate-draft” sometimes, and I also liked the “haunt” cards. I didn’t care much for the flipping mechanism.  Something I almost never mention is the box size (notice that I own the microbadge “I hate big boxes for little games!”). Fairy Tale takes up extremely little space (it comes in a Coloretto-sized box) which is awesome for my storage situation, so I’m going to hang onto it for now. However, if it came in a 7 Wonders-sized box I would sell it, so that probably tells you how I feel. It’s an okay game and I would play it from time to time, but it’s no 7 Wonders! If you're in the mood for a drafting game and are only 2-3 players, 7 Wonders is probably worse than Fairy Tale, but I would rather play Among the Stars than Fairy Tale if there were only 2-3 players. Or probably just play something else.",True
375,It is a good and solid game but not to my taste.,True
376,"This has been well received by family and gamers alike as a co-operative venture, where you get to jointly overcome the game rather than compete against each other. And there's no accidental about it - you *have* to co-operate to win by sharing and consolidating the treasure cards you pick up into one person's hand. Turns are generally straightforward - you're moving around (each tile is an action) to get next to a flooded (flipped) tile and undo the flood (because if it floods again, you'll lose that tile) or you're moving to someone else's spot and giving them a card. Once someone gets 4 of a kind, they trade it in on the right tile for 1 of the 4 treasures. Once you have all 4 treasures, everyone get to the home tile and play a helicopter card to win. So the game is all moving, flipping, sharing. It's easy enough for smart 7 year olds to pick up, and good for family, although it can be hard for kids to kick the competitive habit and truly understand that it really doesn't matter who saves the treasure without the need to get sulky. A good result is dependent on your ability to not have to spend actions moving, instead saving them for card sharing and flipping / saving tiles. It’s especially so at the harder levels. And this will depend on how the treasure cards come out (you want each player to receive just 1 type rather than each type being split amongst everyone) and whether the flood tiles are close to you or further away. The more you play, the more you realise your result is a function of this card distribution. The available actions are limited. The interesting and challenging choices that those used to the dynamism and broad possibilities of Pandemic may expect are not there, so it certainly doesn't replace it on the shelves. But it can be fun if everyone plays in good spirit. It creates some tension along the way and offers a nice sense of satisfaction when you succeed. It has its niche, and it racked up 10 plays in a matter of days so I’m starting this as an 8, but I could see it dropping to a 7 over time as we continue to do all the right things and become slightly disillusioned with the luck.",True

383,"The more I’m in this hobby, the more present to me how some euro games are essentially competitive solitaire vs others that are built on emergent play between players. Odin is definitely of the former ilk whereas I prefer the latter. But it’s good at what it does. You just need to make sure you want this kind of experience before you sit down.   It’s a [caution: analogy overload] Frankenstein creation on steroids drinking a Red Bull. You’ve got 60ish possible action choices with various goods (puzzle pieces) that need to be collected and a literal Tetris puzzle. A thrust of the game is upgrading your puzzle pieces such that they fit better onto your player boards (some can only go in certain places, some can only touch diagonally, etc.). It’s a bear to teach/learn, but it plays remarkably smoother than I expected.  I quite like the way the 60ish action spaces work. They’re in categories (for ex, collect resources, buy boats, go hunting, etc.) so it’s not quite as overwhelming as it sounds. But the innovation is that you can place 1 to 4 of your workers and get a commensurate return. This ROI mechanism makes for some really interesting choices and, for me, is the highlight of the experience. Fitting the pieces onto the board, well, I never enjoyed Tetris but it was a good challenge.  There are some random elements here with dice and cards. The dice didn’t bother me because they were a push-your-luck mechanism for going hunting/pillaging and you can over-prepare as insurance. The cards, however, are the weakest part of the game. There are some that fit ever so nicely with your efforts and others that don’t. Out of 10 cards I found 2 worth playing. I could see them coloring the experience too much if one player had a fortuitous set as every little bit helps.   There isn’t a lot of interaction. Players will generally go their separate ways and fight over just a few of the action spots. The fun is being able to make your own figurative and literal puzzle come together better than theirs while occasionally beating someone to a key action space (usually later in the game). Fitting this altogether in one’s head and on your player boards requires a good bit of deliberation. Figure on 1h15m per player, at least at first.",True

The improvements in the expansion specifically address the well sited flaws in the base game.    The concepts are great and this really should have worked out of the box (Especially as they had two other tries to get it right), but it just has too many flaws to justify playing this on its own.    TI3 is a fantastic work in progress. On it's own tt really should get a 4, but what works in the new version is so great that I'm hard pressed to say I don't like it.

389,"Played this for the first time in many, many years recently (with the first expansion which was a first for me).  So first up: I have a heavy bias against these types of extremely long ""epic"" games with tons of rules overhead, etc. It's just really, really not my bag. [i]Additionally, I'm not even into 4X games[/i] as they tend to be all about turtling, which I really dislike, and is certainly true of this game. Being the first to strike at someone else generally just means you're opening yourself up to attacks from other players.  That said - with the first expansion mixed in this is about as much fun as I can have with one of these kinds of games. I can genuinely have fun with these, but it's very much a mood thing for me.  This game still gets a 4 because without the expansion's replacement role cards, the game of keep-away that happens with the ""gain 2 vp"" role card just irritates me. Yeah it makes the game shorter, but christ, there must be other ways to achieve that (play to less VP, for example) without instead making the whole game revolve around this one stupid role card.  Unsurprisingly for an ""epic"" American 4X game, combat is pretty cumbersome and mostly revolves around a fairly standard roll-to-resolve system with some swingy action cards to shake things up. It also becomes increasingly long and complex as the game progresses as players obtain more relevant tech, with no real interesting decisions to be made during combat rounds. Building up your fleet and tech trees is fun and satisfying, but I will always take a game with more going on [i]during[/i] combat over this.  And speaking of tech trees, one of my huge complaints with this game is just the presentation. It feels like there's been no attempt made to help the players keep track of their ever-changing stat bonuses and perks. In a game with SO much to keep track of, having these dinky little tech cards all over the place just doesn't cut it. The game would have benefited HUGELY from some kind of adjustable character sheet (ala Eclipse). The next time I play I'm definitely going to try out one of those fan-made iOS apps, because the way it is now is just garbage and does nothing but lengthen the game unnecessarily.  In general, it feels like there's a bunch of neat ideas here that presented some real balance and length issues and the way the designers attempted to correct them is just to add a ton of swingy content and these little micro-systems all over the place.   For example, the only way I can imagine the leaders are a necessary part of the base game is if they're there for balance purposes. But addressing a balance issue by adding in this tiny ancillary system that feels like it could be removed wholesale just makes me rage. It may seem like a small thing but all of these little things add up.  And don't even get me started on the swingy content. Ancient Artifact, where you can wipe someone out from Mecatol Rex entirely? Or how about all of those ""You win the game!"" objective cards? All of these things speak to greater issues with the game.  Update: Last time we played I tried one of the iOS companion apps - it really, really sped the game up for me. So (a) I highly recommend using one if you're going to play this and (b) I have confirmation that the game's poor presentation w/r/t your units' ever-changing stats, etc., slows the game down.",True

The basic ruleset seems to be rather robust while still allowing for a lot of flexibility in writing the story and designing the puzzles. My prediction is that the true potential of this game is yet to be seen, since it really boils down to the skills of the authors of the future stories. Basically the options are infinite.  So, I think it will be unfair to judge the game on a basis of a single story since the next one may be worse or better. As a matter of fact, T.I.M.E Stories is a platform while the game comes in the scenarios. The first scenario included in the base game was purely designed for one time use with no replay value whatsoever. But this does not have to be the case, since future scenarios may well stand the test of multiple plays. It is just a question how cunning the designers become.

426,"Initial rating based on one solo play!  Quite like the art - definitely like the implementation of the theme. Rules are pretty straightforward (and clear). Like the idea of scenarios/quests - although the core game only has limited options, and the co-op (and solo) nature is a nice change from either a ""you play hero I'll play Sauron"" or 'race for points'.  I like that it's a LCG rather than a CCG, and I like the fact there is deckbuilding.  However all might not be great, first experience was a blow-out, got crushed and I don't think it was poor play on my part. I wonder how much of the game is determined by the random order of the encounter deck, rather than the player decisions (ie. do you play the game, or does it play you).  Need to play it more, and try some expansion packs. Rating likely to change, just not sure in which direction at the moment!  ** Update, played it more, both Solo and 2 player, and I'm liking it more, but the 3 scenario limit of the core set seems rather miserly, fortunately there are some great player made scenarios for variety. Rating increased to 8 for now ...

429,"A roll-and-move car racing game with a bazillion expansion tracks.  Tracks have variable numbers of lanes and turns. Cars can take hits on their tires, brakes, fuel, engines, or body. There are 6 gears, each associated with a different modified (i.e., not usual distribution) die (d4 --> d30). Players start in 1st gear and can shift up or down 1 gear each turn for free. Each turn requires 1-3 stops; may skip 1 of these and take damage to tires (skipping >1 --> car explodes). Brakes are used to slow down and to downshift quickly, gas to downshift quickly, engines to downshift very quickly. If you take maximum damage in any of these, your car explodes. You can take 1 pitstop (typical 2 or 3 lap race), where tires are replaced.   There are a lot of extra rules about passing, lane changes, slipstreaming ... and even weather. Lots of complexity, but a LOT of dice: rolloff for pole position; roll every turn for movement; if you end up next to someone, roll to see if anyone takes body damage; if any player is in 5th or 6th and rolls max speed, ALL players in 5th or 6th gear roll to see if they take engine damage; when you pit, roll to see how quickly you come out of the pit. The game is definitely more than just a dicefest -- you need to know how to handle the turns, when to move in and out, when to use up your car, etc. -- but to me it doesn't feel like there's much more!

434,"In the island of Bora, Bora there are 6 rounds. Each round you roll three dice. You place dice, one at a time on action tiles to do the action: expand by water or land, take a man tile, take a woman tile, build, put a priest on a temple or do a helper action. The higher the dice you put on the action tile, typically the higher amount of things you get to do. However, subsequent plays on that action tile can only be dice that are of lower value.   You then decide to use one man and one woman tile (which are variants of the action tile). Finally you complete tasks, buy jewels and draw more task tiles.  Finally added to the mix are God cards which let you score fish, or modify dice, or give you more man/woman actions.  In the endgame you score points for being adjacent to fish (the last one in gets the fish points).   There are a myriad of ways to score points, which may turn some people off. I don't mind it, but certainly this is one of Feld's more complex games. I enjoy the various challenges of trying to meet tasks, and you are jammed for actions.

A good dose of luck in the dice as usual but even more so in the missions which is where you get your points from, these come from a random draw at the end of your turn but at least you have several to choose from.

This is a very confrontational game even though there is a lot of Euro aspects to the game.

448,"I want to rate this higher because it's highly a strategic euro with an approachable theme, but I just can't.  The first reason is that I find it to be too fiddly.  The second is that I feel the cards introduce a catch 22: The cards seem to be a little on the unbalanced side.  To rectify this people can play the 'Family' version which has no occupations/minor improvements.  In doing so, players can't accomplish as much in the game which takes away some of the fun and more importantly there will be a LOT less variety from game to game. Drafting is another method that addresses the problem with card balance. The benefit of drafting, other than a balancing mechanism, is that you can try to draft cards to match a specific strategy you want to try rather than virtually being forced to use the strategy that you've been dealt. An example of this is having to play an early plowing strategy due to being dealt the Field Watchman. The issue with this is that drafting does add a fair chunk of time to a game already of medium to high length depending on the number of players.  After further plays I dislike the end game scoring because you're always trying to get at least some of everything, instead of doing what you want.  After further plays, I feel that the player that's able to grow their family the earliest has a huge advantage and will likely win the game.  Due to this mechanism, I don't feel that Agricola is as strong a worker placement game as Uwe's Ora et Labora, All Creatures Big and Small, and Fields of Arle.",True
449,"Players represent medieval farmers, working their own 15 spaces of land.  The game is played over 14 turns, interrupted every now and again by harvest time.  The beginning of each turn sees areas of the boards seeded with stuff to make them increasingly attractive (wood, clay, animals, etc).  Players then take actions with their farmers (start with two, but can increase to five) to do stuff - build, renovate, plough, reap, breed, bake, etc.  It's all about growth and expansion, with the ultimate goal to have your 15 spaces brimming with food and animals.  Nicely executed game, great theme.  A couple of astonishing things - the innocuous looking box is jam packed full of stuff - wood, boards, playing cards.  In addition, the game comes with hundreds of cards, roughly divided into ""jobs"" and ""items"" that grant players additional abilities if they can get them into play.  This turns a rather dry game into something you can play for years and still discover things you hadn't seen before.  The designer, developer, artist and playtesters must have gone bonkers balancing all this out into a nice, playable game.

Very, very interactive, especially when there is no true structure to the trading.... anything goes. This type of game might be a turnoff for some, but as long as everyone is not a total introvert, or at least has 10% of a used-car salesman inside them... this game will help them discover it.  If every negotiation game needs a ""driver"" to generate the haggling, Chinatown's drivers are the need to collect certain tiles, followed by the need to gather the adjacent spots to place those tiles. There's never any downtime in Chinatown, as the round ends when everyone decides it should end. There are strong motivations for negotiating.  Another perk is that Chinatown is truly a gateway game. It's very accessible for new gamers, and the incredibly attractive Z-Man Games edition adds to the pull for newbies. There is a single but important nitpick--I can see the merit to critiques about the endgame grinding to a halt if gamers start to ""do the math"" in the final rounds, but the remedy is to pick the right players, and possibly, to introduce the optional bonus cards that dole out a little extra cash for certain building sizes.

472,"Goa merges auctions with a spatial element with resource management and tech trees.  The first thing that struck me about the game was the auctions.  You start with a grid of tiles with various abilities.  The first player places the first player maker next to one of these tiles and places one of his auction markers on it.  Subsequent players will place their auction markers on tiles diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to the previously played marker.  After markers have been placed you'll have a 'once around' auction ala Ra (the person who is auctioning bids last) and if someone else wins the auction, they pay the auctioneer.  If the auctioneer wins, they pay the bank.  After that you'll use actions to gain resources (a number of types of spices, money, ships, and colonists), increase your tech and set up colonies.  This is a decent mid-weight euro that works with all player counts who I would recommend to any one that likes auctions and either tech trees and/or resource management.

478,"A lot of what happens in Thebes is luck of the draw, which many people won't like. Normally I'd share that opinion, but so much of what happens is both mechanically clever and thematically appropriate that I just don't care. The primary action is drawing cards, for ""study"". The more knowledge the card gives you, the more time it takes you to learn it. Pick a deep tome and your opponents will take three or four turns before you get to go again.  Of course, having a boatload of knowledge about the area and the historical era you are searching for provides you with a huge advantage when it is time to go digging. Again, the game thematically shines here. You reach into a bag and pull chits, half of which are just empty dirt. When you pull dirt, it goes right back into the bag. The more an area is worked, the harder it becomes to find something valuable. It's an ingenious abstraction of archaeology...and one you will often curse when you spend 10 weeks pulling 8 chits and only managing to get three fairly worthless artifacts.  So yeah, there is a lot of luck. But it feels completely appropriate to the subject matter.

517,"This is a great game. It plays extremely fast (around half an hour) and plays 3-7 player in ALMOST exactly the same way - and in the same time!  It's a good light civilization card game which I think fills a unique niche; I cannot really compare 7 Wonders to many other games. The symbols and how the ressources work can be hard for newcomers to figure out at first, but once they have tried a game, they know what to do the next time - which will probably be right after the first game as it's such a fast game!   Even though it's a fast game, you actually feel that you are building your own small civilization, especially because of your own unique wonder (which are all pretty well balanced, and I like how there are 2 different sides to choose from).   When playing with 3 players there is much less luck as you will get your starting hand back and everybody have access to the same starting ressources and influence each other militaristic. If you are playing with 6 or 7 players, there is more luck involved as you never know which cards will be passed to you by your neighbour, but I don't mind this aspect.   Regarding strategy, I think that the different paths are pretty balanced though it does seem that, in our games, the blue civil cards have been granting the most VPs, but the green scientific cards and red military cards have won their fair share of games too. A good mix of the different cards can be okay too sometimes, but it really depends on how many players you are, which wonder you have and which cards you are dealt etc., so you cannot declare a superior strategy... I also like the guild cards and how they are mixed into the deck randomly.  The expansion adds a little something different to the game and I can't wait to see the rest of the expansions. The promo wonders Manneken Pis and Catan are okay wonders but not some I use when playing with fewer than 5 players.  This is one of those games you want to have in your collection.

I liked how this game had more options to reduce waste from one's hand.  The turns seemed a little quicker without having +action cards.  I also liked the board, which brought an additional element to focus on vs typical deck building games.  My main concern was that it felt more ""solitaire"" versus Dominion.

With only 30 tiles available in the game (and only a little more than half of them are able to attack), the luck of the draw seems to have a large effect on the outcome.  Example: Let's say in my first 3 - 4 turns I draw two combat units whereas my opponent draws about 4 - 5, that puts me at a major disadvantage because my units will likely die in the first battle and it's possible that none of my opponents would if he had a chance to lay some of those five units after I placed my two.  In future rounds, I would now have all of those units to deal with and only limited/suicidal spaces to lay my own units.  This happened to me on my first game.

Early moves are just crucial, get it wrong and you may as well not play the rest of the game (shame there's no way to liquidate your company).

And the way you build your deck and play cards is novel. I would like to see a proper game utilize those elements, and maybe add some level of randomness.

What's not fine is that when someone starts doing well, other players may get locked out.  A strong engine doesn't just snowball, it also squashes other players.  With 2-4 hour playtime, it's not acceptable to get locked out for a mistake on turn 1 or 2.  It's also definitely a game where winners take longer and longer turns while losers take shorter and shorter turns, so it's quite tedious to be losing.

The graphic design is busy, busy, busy, and a bit of a visual headache.   The theme really isn't there, but that's not terribly surprising.   None of the mini-games are complex, but the way that everything works together will take a round or two to become clear.  It's a very mechanical game, and somewhat cold as a result.

You are collecting sets of various items that increase if you get more of those items.    I found it about the same weight as Trajan, but lacking the excitement that Trajan brings to the game.

573,"I'm happy that I upgraded from Formula De. The snazzy dashboards and the better-looking cars really add to the enjoyment. I also like that they've added two new modes of play.  The ""rules for beginners"" are similar to the rules from Formula De Mini, with universal wear points that are not broken down into tires, brakes, engine, etc. They're good for casual play, although I think 18 points is way too many for one lap. Something like 12 is probably better.  The ""rules for advanced players"" are practically the same as the old Formula De advanced rules. The biggest difference I noticed is that the car damage does not vary by race length. All the cars are 6/3/3/3/3/2 or alternatively 20 points assigned as you like. In the old Formula De, one-lap cars were 4/3/2/2/2, two-lap cars were 6/4/3/3/3 (no road handling for 1 or 2 laps), and three-lap cars were 20 points freely assigned.  The street racing rules are new in this edition. They add a once-per-lap nitro boost, individual drivers with special abilities, and street courses featuring special hazards. You can also mix it up and use street racing rules on the Formula tracks, or Formula racing rules on the street courses.

Euro-hoz képest egész sok kütyü van benne, a setup se 2 perc, de ez a setup jó arra, hogy ne legyen 2 egyforma parti. A térképen szereplő városok jellemzőit random kártyákkal határozzuk meg, és minden játékos random szerepet kap, és ezek a szerepek adják a játék sava-borsát. Az alapszabályok is nagyon jól egybe vannak gyúrva, de ezek a szerepek még adnak az egésznek egy erős csavart. Az egyik, ami nagyon tetszett az a kockák egymásra helyezése. A másik ami jó, hogy a térkép tematikus. A Himaláya az Himaláya, azt nem lehet csak úgy kerülgetni. Ha valaki elindul egyik úton, az elég komolyan elkötelezi magát, és mivel összesen 4 vagy 5 teljesen különálló út van, legalább ennyi teljesen különálló kombó kínálkozik a városok tulajdonságaiból. Persze van olyan szerep vagy olyan kártyák, amik segítségével akár egész nagy része is beutazható a térképnek, illetve nem is feltétlenül kell erőltetni az utazást, lehet hogy valakinek a szerződések teljesítése szimpatikusabb. Ha nem lenne elég a városokban rejlő sok lehetőség, vannak beépített akciók is. Ideiglenesen szerezhetők újabb kockák, amik nagyon megnövelik a lehetőségeinket. A játék a sokrétűsége ellenére nagyon koherens, nem nagyon tudnék belekötni. Talán egyedül a célkártyákat érzem kicsit feleslegesnek, és a szerepek kiegyensúlyozottsága kérdéses, de szerintem mindegyikkel lehet nyerni. A játék a bonyolultságához képest egész rövid, 2 óra kb.

Egyedüli hibájának talán a kezdőjátékos sorrendjét eldöntő mechanizmust érzem, illetve azt, hogy magának a kezdőjátékosnak talán kicsit nagy az előnye.

They also have initiative 0-3, and possibly bonus HP (most units die after 1 hit). In addition, there is a headquarters (20 hit points; you're eliminated if it gets down to 0), modules that give some adjacent hexes bonuses or penalties, and several single-use action tiles (move tiles, attack hex adjacent to HQ, drop bomb on hex and hit it and adjacent hexes, and push a tile into an adjacent empty space). Each army has a different configuration, and will need to be played differently.  First few turns, just place your HQ. During game, draw to hand size 3, then discard 1 from game; either play, discard or keep the other two. Battles ONLY occur when you play a Battle tile, as well as a final battle at the end of the game. Battles are in descending initiative order (so low-initiative units may be killed and removed before they ever get to attack).

692,"Assuming you have the Kickstarter deluxe version, this is a gorgeous production. I'm happy to say that the gameplay is almost as good. The game is sort of a mix between Terra Mystica and Dune. Like Terra Mystica, the focus of the game is clearing your player board of buildings as efficiently as possible. The Dune side of things is the combat system. it is zero luck, with both sides bidding a number of troops and then adding a card or two to the bid, after which all are lost.  I think the most innovative thing about Scythe is the way it handles heroes and quests. Instead of the usual random card and wall of text, Scythe offers the players a beautiful painting to set the scene and then a couple of options for your hero to react to it. These usually fall along the Paragon/Neutral/Renegade decision tree found in many video games. How you behave determines your scoring opportunities in later rounds, which is a neat idea.  Another thing I like is the resource system. When goods are produced, they sit in their space of origin until a player uses them. This is a genius idea that opens up all sorts of strategies, both offensively and defensively.  My only concern is that it could get samey over multiple games, as there is probably a best path through every player board.  ",True
693,"About [thing=169786][/thing]:  [b]1) What is it?[/b] Is an optimization euro with asymmetric positions, costs and abilities and with some sprinkled combat, area control, random encounters and a tad of a race game. There were (and likely still are) plenty of arguments around the fact the designer said that [thing=169786][/thing] is a 4X game. I didn't see it. I wouldn't called it that way to others. But if one wants, hey, be my guess.  [thing=169786][/thing] has a light amount of interaction, mostly for board position. Yet, for the most part, you will do your thing, the others will do theirs, and rarely one will care to see what you are doing. It will be more an affair of ""pass me 3 food"", or ""raise my popularity by 1"", or ""I'm building this, here"".   There is a high amount of decisions points offered by the game, and several paths to follow, though the nation and action board taken do narrow the possibilities, since the game rewards optimization, it pays better to make actions more suited to your advantages.  The game bits are great and the art on the card and player boards are, as expected, amazing. The kickstarter version comes with some awesome metal coins and special resource tokens.  Playing time, though not really short, sits comfortably in a game night, lasting around 2 hours, even with 5 players. Downtime increases the more players at the table, but isn't a big issue, as the actions are limited and executed quickly, most of the time (combat is also done fast).  The theme, while a big initial draw to many, due to Jakub's art, passes under the radar almost all the time during play. Rarely did we make a thematic connection between an action in game to what nation we were. The encounters have some nice tidbits of theme and worldbuilding, but we simply passed above many, as the next player was already carrying out his action, yet, eventually we heard a ""So, I stopped to let the geese cross the road..."" - seems proper.  Overall, the [thing=169786][/thing] works smoothly and well enough, even if it brings little actual theme and mechanical innovations to the table.  [b]2) How do you play?[/b] Each player is represented by a nation, with special abilities, correlations and unique costs for building stuff. The goal of the game is to have more money at the end. Stars, areas controlled and resources are worth money at the end of the game - these are multiplied by the popularity the player has. Also, players gain money when doing things (building, encounters, etc) during the play, but some actions also cost money to be done.  The simple way to say what happens during the game is: each turn the player picks an area of her own player board to activate a main action, which are: move, trade, bolster and produce. Then, if able, the player can activate the secondary action associated with the main action (these change between the player boards, and are part of the asymmetry) - these always cost resources to be done, and isn't always possible to be made due to this, specially near the start of the game.  The tricky part is: once an (action) area of the board is activated, it can't be done again in the next turn - a different area must be used.  Mechas and heroes can initiate combat, and is done by, secretly, each player deciding the amount of power to use (adjusting a dial), to a maximum of 7, and if add a combat card (whose power varies from 2 to 5). The highest amount of power wins, and in case of a tie, the attacker wins. Defeated mechas, hero and workers return the the player starting position. Buildings, even from the defeated player, remain. For each worker sent away, the winner loses 1 popularity. All used power (in the dial) is lost, regardless of the result. Resources in the area in which the combat occurred are in possession of the winner.  There are 10 ways of getting stars - winning combat (x2), building all mechas, doing all upgrades, making all buildings, reaching the max popularity or max power, and others. Once a player reaches 6 starts, the game is over, and final scoring will happen. The player with the most money will be the winner!  [b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b] Several. What action to do each turn - and this is two fold, as every action on the board is divided in two - and, sometimes, you will truly want to make the action above, but won't be able to make the bellow, and in a optimization game, this is usually not a good thing. Therefore, it might be worth more to delay the coveted action for a turn or two, to make the best of it, as once used, the action can't be done (usually) again in the next turn.  And all actions also have connected decisions: where to move, what resources to take, which option to pick from an encounter, what to build and where (from proper buildings, to mechs, as each uncover a special ability, to upgrades and enlists), and many others. If a battle starts, there is considerations about the amount of power to use and if/which combat card to add.  Overall, there is plenty points of decisions - most not all that difficult, to the point to induce to some severe analisis paralisis, but enough to make each matter and have lasting effects in the board state and in your game.  [b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b] - Excellent components; - Several options to choose from in each turn; - Clear objectives that all players can go after; - Asymmetric, as all nations have unique abilities and different costs for actions; - Downtime is rather small; - Combat causes little damage for the player that loses, and there is basically no player elimination; - Little luck, kept in the draw of combat and encounter cards.  [b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b] - Small interaction and even interest in what the other players are doing for most of the time; - The art on the board can get in the way of seeing the situation of the play; - A collage of mechanisms (from Kemet, Dune, Antike, euros of optimization, etc) in a whole that, while it works well enough, has little innovation; - The theme is, sadly, lost during play.  [b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b] ""So, popularity rises the amount of money you will get."" ""Like [thing=24181][/thing]?"" ""Yes, mostly, but just for you.  ""The board is big, as you can see, but every place is kind of near to each other, once Mines are made."" ""Reminds me what happens in [thing=127023][/thing]."" ""Close. There can be the same pressure and the thought that no place is truly completely safe. Anyway, in the battle you bid an amount of power and may or not add a card to boost the total."" ""Ah, like [thing=121][/thing]?"" ""But with phantom units - you don't handle armies, just a level of power. And without f***** traitor generals."" (A sore spot.) ""The goal is to have the most money in the end. Yes, like [thing=24181][/thing], things in the board help, but money in the pocket is what counts. The game ends when someone reaches 6 stars, and stars you get when you do one of 10 objectives."" ""Sort like the objectives in [thing=166857][/thing]."" ""Hum, sure, sort of. There isn't such a race here, as is only the trigger to end, not the end goal itself.""  (...) And a whole lot of this. It feels like playing parts of several top notch games, not all taken to the fullest, some being more waterdown, but I could still find connections: like trying to make the best of the main and secondary action and not being able to use them again for a time remind me of [thing=59294][/thing] (and also having heroes exploring the map); the resources on the board that can be taken and/or used by others, some economic and pick and deliver games; and so on.  At first the game seemed daunting, with so many options and branching paths to acquire money, resources, popularity, power, etc. But once we started playing, things fell nicely into place, and though there is a fine level of possibilities, each one is clearly defined, contained in a simple action to be carried on, to the point that even a friend of mine, who usually struggle to understand quickly the mechanics of a game, did learn the ways of [thing=169786][/thing] rather fast.  I can understand the hype around it, though I don't really share the same amount of love many have, as, for me, [thing=169786][/thing] is a well done game, interesting and smart, taking good parts of other games and making a whole that works nicely together. But not groundbreaking, particularly innovative or inventive, nor has an awesome factor besides the art, which just sits in the background, as does the rest of the theme.",True

700,"This is a re-implementation of Evolution: The Origin of Species.  Players are each playing a species of animals and evolving them with cards that give them different traits while struggling to keep them all fed.  I didn't care for that game much at all but this one does a lot to fix the biggest problems of that game.  First of all, random dice rolls determining the amount of food in the watering hole has been replaced with players playing cards showing how much food they wish to place.  This is a great change as players not only have more control but it also forces them to acknowledge the opportunity cost of which card they cannot play as a trait each round.  Also, carnivores have been re-balanced.  I felt they were oppressively powerful in the original design and now have seen them both ineffective and extremely dangerous if played right.  I love the additions of population to keep a species out even after being eaten and body size as an inherent way to protect your species from carnivores, both also do a lot towards balancing carnivores from the original.  Finally, it is altogether just a lot cleaner.  You can still play each card in multiple ways.  As a trait, food, new species, or increase of population or body size but no longer have to deal with flipping the cards around and the increase of food cost has been replaced with a simple 3-trait limit on each species.  Also, the artwork is gorgeous and evocative.  The game really hits that sweet spot of theme and mechanics as well as simplicity and depth.  It's awesome to imagine what kind of creature you are creating with the provided traits and the game even comes with a grid to help you name your creature based on its triats.  It is also a game you can teach to almost anybody, the same deck of cards is used for pretty much everything and it all works really smoothly together.  All of this while providing a wealth of decisions and depth of mechanics.  I love the mechanic of having the same card provide multiple different effects.  It forces you to always consider the opportunity cost when you play the card for one purpose over another.  There is strategy to be found in every action.  Do you put more food in the watering hole or try to starve out other species.  Your strategy can even change considerably based on turn order.  First place can be important because you get the most number of shots at food and especially as a carnivore can eat another species before it can get to you.  While in last place when taking actions you get to alter your decisions based on what the players ahead of you do.  I do think it has a rich-get-richer problem.  It does its best to alleviate this by rewarding dead species with card draw of that species trait cards but still I feel like once you get ahead in this game it is hard to be unseated.",True

702,"I learned a dozen new games this past weekend at a local con, and surprisingly this was my favorite.  [i]Evolution[/i] is interactive, well-designed, easy to learn (without being too simplistic), and seemingly a decent simulation of the rise and fall of imaginary species.  My only concern is whether certain card combinations are so powerful as to be insidious game-killers, and whether it's ten times more fun to be a carnivore than a herbivore.  Either issue could be a drag on an otherwise excellent game, though the latter concern is largely mitigated by the fact that players can control multiple species simultaneously.  I'm hopeful that we won't hit the ""we've figured this out"" ceiling anytime soon, and at first glance the game is good enough that I could be coaxed out of my purchasing hibernation to acquire a copy.  [i]Update:[/i]  Peaceful players will discover that fielding a herbivore-only team isn't terribly exciting.  And if no one goes carnivore at all, the game falls into a rut of fighting over scraps of plant food.  But it isn't always fun to be a predator, either, since many improvements are anti-carnivore - which can lead to quick extinction for new meat-eaters.  Looking to buy? Since I'm all about truth in advertising, there are five reasons why you might hate this game:  1. You don't like being ""mean"" to other players by eating their species. (Your own carnivores could eat your own smaller species, but what fun is that?)  2. It makes you upset when your species are eaten by other players' carnivores.  3. If no one decides to become a carnivore (due to #1 or #2), this literally becomes the most boring game of all time. As described above, many traits are anti-carnivore - and therefore useless in an all-herbivore game - and herbivore players are limited to low-key food competition and spawning new species.  4. Some trait combinations are quite powerful, and certain players can get lucky and draw those particular traits.  5. Due to the multi-layered trait interactions, there is a potential for significant downtime, depending on the number of players and their thinkiness. I'm not sure that I'd play with more than 4 players, for instance, since keeping track of the trait combinations and body sizes would cause me to blow a processor.  Anyway, I can see this being a great game with my high-interaction gaming group. People will enjoy eating one another, watching species starve for lack of food, laughing at the victims, and getting revenge. If that isn't your bag, you might skip it.  It's certainly worth a play, either way. It is a very good game, and even better with the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/176173/evolution-flight]Flight[/url] expansion.",True

NINCOMPOOPS! :P   Yes well, now that I got that out of my system there is a really nice little system here. Don't believe the haters, mostly unwarranted complaints is all I see so far although people who dont like some screwage might just do better to avoid this (its not really high but its there to be sure)  Yes there is a little Caylus with how the road resolves in order and of course the worker placement but the game does not feel like Caylus at all and the theme really comes out very nice in this game, I was put off by the Caylus comparisons but to me this is a non-issue and the game feels quite original even though there is nothing really new.   So in the old west players are fighting for land and good land plots and trying to gain as much income as possible over only 4 rounds with only 4 - 8 cowboys to use per round. In turn order roles are selected to help you in the round and then buildings are laid out on the road. Players can attempt to buy the buildings (sliding scale) but other players can also try to claim the same building. This creates a duel and a player adds up his fire power and plays one of his handful of tiles (numbered 0 to 5, randomly distributed, slight bluffing aspect, extra money given for low gun count) against another to see who will buy the building, loser gets his worker back to use in the next round and it counts in the current round as +1 fire power. Note that these duels can be a little tricky to judge in the first round (there shouldnt be many anyway) but as the game progresses they usually become easier to calculate and can even be quite deterministic. Losing can hurt for sure even though you get compensated and that is part of the theme and game, it stung me more in my second game than the first and it hurt my income. If you are low on guns planning can be pretty tricky since you are never sure which things might be fought after, this might mean passing first to get first pick of character in next round to help with this.    Cowboys can also claim new land plots and these are needed to build the buildings on. Certian spots are more lucrative than others due to surrounding buildings but only neutral and your own buildings will help. Buildings generate income and at the end of each round there is an option to buy VP's if you visited the ""VP store""(hehe) and did not lose a duel there.  Buildings are also subject to duels so if someone is making a pile of money you can try to get your share unless 1 of the 2 churches is built near by which ensures peace. One thing I noticed is by taking the Sheriff someone can lock down the only VP spot left in the last round, because only 2 characters let you keep more than 30 dollars, this seems like it ""could"" be too strong but possibly not. You can buy up land for points but this costs you one action per land, more play is needed to see if this is balanced. Again careful planning is needed here as you dont want to be throwing away money or doing lots of high conversion to VP's.    Essentially thats the game.  Its a nice mix of strategy, tactics, theme, high interaction and fun all in 90 Minutes. It looks like there might be multiple paths here, Guns look very important but someone won our last game with only ONE gun LOSING most duels so planning is rewarded here and there are other ways to get VP's like how much land you own, etc. The role that doubles your land seems very powerful and you might have to ""take one for the team"" to stop someone from getting too much income, wasnt crazy about this one aspect (not sure how big it is yet) but there are a couple other ways to try and combat it as well like stealing the income. 4 most likely the best number for this, 3 and 5 should be okay but 4 best I think (just the right amount of competition)   ",True

[b]--- Summary ---[/b] Like Agricola, except: - dwarves instead of humans - you have a mountain into which you carve space used for dwellings (one/person; no upgrading) and buildings - no cards; instead, there is a display of tiles from which EVERYONE can choose - more animal/resource types - harvest occurs at semi-random intervals - can make food, at fixed ratios of resource:food, at any time - ""fighting"" dwarves: used to send people on expeditions (you don't fight other players) - slightly different point rewards for people, space, etc., and lower penalties for missing stuff; and SIMPLER scoring (most things are worth 1VP) - less oppressive pressure to get your stuff done before someone else takes that action spot! - more streamlined ",True
741,"Very good dice Action-point game. Players try to juggle building up regions and racing to complete them before everyone else. Each region has a specific bonus and its quite fun trying to build up a city the way you want to. Multiple boards also lend a great deal of replayability to the game.  [Suggestion] I will probably play with 4 phases instead of 5. This shortens the game substantially. In the normal game, it becomes too easy to complete everything and I feel that the game loses a lot of the tension.",True

759,"[2011-12-10] 2009-es esseni sikerjáték. Nem véletlenül. Tipikus gémerjáték. Absztrakt, számolgatós, de ebből a típusból az egyik legjobb. A játékosok a Hansa városokban járnak a kereskedőikkel és házakat, útszakaszokat foglalnak el. Nagyon sokfajta pontszerzési lehetőség, óriási szabadság, talán a legszabadabb játék, amivel eddig találkoztam. Nagyon sokfajta út a győzelemig és rövid játékidő. Tényleg minden elemében nagyon jó a játék. Legjobban a dinamikus vége tetszett, pedig a fix körös játékokat kedvelem jobban. Ha valaki eléri játék közben a húsz pontot rögtön jön a pontozás. Nagyon jó stratégiákat lehet kidolgozni, tényleg jól működik a játék. De csontszáraz cserébe. Még a Power Gridnél is szárazabb, nem éppen családi és úgy érzem x játék után egy jó fejű embert nem igazán lehetne benne megverni, max. egy többszemélyesben, ahol bekavarhatnak a többiek. Mondjuk pont ezért volt órási siker a gémerek körében. A szerencse egyedül a bónuszlapkák behozásánál jön elő. Nekem ez nem hiányzott bele, de gondolom úgy érezték ennyit kell bele tenni.  [2011-12-17] Öten is tökéletesen működik, nagyon kiegyensúlyozott a kétoldalas tábla.

Az előrejelzések, és a szabálymagyarázat alapján valami ijesztőbbre számítottam, de ez egy kifejezetten könnyed, pörgős játék, csak meg kell szokni a világát, mert elég egyedi! Gyorsan sorra kerülünk (3 fős parti volt), és általában a jó és a még jobb közül lehet választani, nehézségét és ütemét tekintve a rondellásokhoz tudom hasonlítani (Hamburgum), csak itt még nagyobb a szabadság, mert nem köt minket a rondella. És azt hiszem ezzel el is érkeztem a játék lényegéhez: a néhány jól kitalált akció szinte végtelen lehetőséget kínál, és számtalan nyerő stratégia sejlett fel a két parti során. Kreatív emberek előnyben! A játék folyamatosan alkalmazkodást igényel a többiekhez, az is bizonytalan, hogy mikor fejeződik be a játék, szóval erősen taktikai játék! A segédlet jó, a játék teljesen nyelvfüggetlen (bár magyar szabály még nincs), és szerintem kifejezetten szép! Aki tud lelkesedni pusztán egy jól kitalált mechanizmusért, annak kötelező darab.

We haven't seen a run like this since Stephan Feld's 2007-2013 stretch, where every game seemed to be better than the last, with all of them being worthy of a greatest hits compilation. Great Western Trail is easily the best thing to come out of Essen 2016.  The game is sort of like Caylus, but with a deck building aspect. Players drive cattle from Texas to Kansas City, attempting to arrive at their destination with the highest value of collected cattle cards in their hand. The catch is that any duplicate cards are not counted. So the primary focus of each cattle run is to find a way to discard duplicate cards while at the same time adding higher valued cattle cards to your deck.  The Caylus vibe comes from the trail itself. It is a forking pathway that starts the game largely empty, but as the game moves on, becomes cluttered with player erected building spaces that both slow and tax anyone that passes over them. This makes every game unique but not random, since how each session develops is completely controlled by the player's actions.  The railroad aspect of the game feels a little tacked on, but I suppose it was something that was added in development, to soak up some money and keep things tight. Regardless, it works and gives everyone one more thing to think about when income from the cattle drive is collected, making that phase something more interesting than a simple clean-up phase.  The learning curve is a little steep for the first game, but once players have been through a full cattle drive, most of it comes together pretty well. I'd say it's about on par with Mombasa, as far as complexity goes. A mouthful to teach, but simple in turn to turn execution. Good stuff.",True

This is the main goal of the game, but in order to do so you have so many things to do and decisions to take. Should I go faster to Kansas or should I go slower but with more actions during the path. Should I build here to stop others, or should do that there to benefit more myself. As already said, the main goal is to deliver your cows to Kansas, and you need a good deck with different cows in different colors and values. This makes the game to be quite easy to understand from the first play, further plays will be used to enjoy more the game and exploit different strategies. In the end you will score for lot of things, all of them following this delivery of cows to Kansas. I think I will never say no to a game of Great western",True
784,"GWT offers a circular, rondel-esque action structure that players build with action tiles as the game progresses. While the trail of actions is one way, it always ends in a delivery of cattle and then starts over again. Players cycle through about 5-7 times before the end conditions are met.  The structure of the game is simple and once you get going the game plays fast. However, there are a lot of options and a lot of symbols to learn, so the game may appear a little daunting at first. While there are many ways to get points, there are few key sources where the majority of points will come and how you choose to focus on these areas is the key to doing well. Players are managing and improving a deck of cattle cards that represent their herd. Building your herd and managing your hand to optimize cattle deliveries is one source. Another is advancing your train to better and better stations. Putting out more of your buildings (action spaces) is another possible source. And another source is gaining and playing goal cards. There are a number of other secondary ways to collect points. If you balance your focus between all of the main sources, you are unlikely to do well. As with a lot of these games, the key is optimizing your decisions to primarily support one or two of these sources while keeping an eye on your opponents and hindering them when you can.  While at first glance a mechanical mish-mash, Pfister has done a very good job of melding the various elements into a cohesive whole.",True

Even after one play I'm reluctant to replay it if some of the players need a rules explanation. When I reentered the hobby almost ten years ago, heavy euros like Amun-Re or Brass needed far less explanations. Vinhos et al. have set a disturbing trend. Not that Great Western Trail isn't worth it. In the opposite; it's a good, potentially very good game. I just wish that it had a bit less overhead.  At its heart is a board that essentially is a huge developing rondel from which players choose their action. I initially had the impression that the development of the board was inspired by Caylus but William doesn't think so. Another essential system is the deck-building and the ensuing hand management. Furthermore, players have to improve their personal boards Hansa Teutonica-style. Three principle strategies are available to aim for: cattle, locomotive, building (in ascending sophistication/difficulty). The good news is that mixed strategies seem to be feasible as well as long as the player manages to squeeze out benefits a bit more efficiently from the game systems.  I only played its predecessor Mombasa once. My impression is that Great Western Trail is a more focused design while Mombasa had more player interaction.",True

But it will disclose its secrets and delights, in form of nuances and strategies, well after many plays.

809,"An absolutely wonderful deduction game, at least for two players. The fact that you need a little luck to find the blood trail and the complex layout of the map keep things interesting. The options are so many and the situation is ever evolving, which precludes you from experiencing that tedious phase of the typical deduction game when you're basically just trying to find the question that eliminates the most dead ends. In practice, frustration and analysis paralysis won't take over you during playing Letters from Whitechapel because not coming up with the most effective question does not make you feel stupid or having lost the game.  The game is interesting for both, the police and Jack players. There is a thick layer of metagaming which helps with immersion immensely. It is not just a question of mechanically converging towards the solution, but you actually have to guess what your opponent is up to. This is something that makes the game more authentic. You can actually feel the heat of the chase, try to pull off the wittiest of bluffs or just simply panic.  A great game truly.",True

""It's impossible for Mr. X unless the detectives are idiots."" It seems most people rate this based on the skills of those with whom they play.   How about a little more objectivity? This game features an excellent central mechanic of hidden movement with minimal clues. The 5 forced reveals for Mr. X provides a high degree of tension and is perfectly balanced by Mr. X's double moves and black tickets. A version of this mechanic became Fury of Dracula, which is also a pretty decent game, but cards in that game muddy up the pure brilliance of the original design. The reason I'm hesitant to rate this higher is that the unchanging geography of the board can lead to similar paths and approaches from game to game, that is, there are good places to hide and bad, and they are the same every game.

The provinces all provide different bonuses, and scoring cards in your hand may make some provinces better based on their location or their attributes, so provinces are worth different amounts to each player.  Bid amounts are fixed to triangular numbers, making it really important to try to figure out what others will bid, as going even one spot ahead of another player can get pricey.

Also, the renegade must be one of the most imbalanced cards in any game – even if the other players played crappy, it should be impossible to win with that character (yes, I know that many of you will probably claim that you’ve won playing the renegade, but man is he severely underpowered and I feel like I have already lost the game when drawing him – which just makes the game feel even longer)!",True

Na jó, a Keyflower talán egy árnyalatnyival jobb, minta másik kettő... A legjobban a licites rész tetszik... egy kicsit Amun-re-s, de annál összetettebb. A többféle licitszín nagyon eredeti ötlet!! A téli épületeket viszont annak ellenére lutrinak érzem, hogy egy részét ismerhetem végig...

Én úgy gondolom optimálisan lehetetlen játszani benne, maximum egy általános stratégiára lehet törekedni. A játékosok négy évszakon át licitálnak Catan szerű lapkákra, amiből a városukat építik. Minden lapkának van egy tulajdonsága, sőt fejlesztés után még ezen tulajdonság jobb formája is rendelkezésre áll. Ezen felül minden lapka a használható is, akárkinél és akárhol is van. Különböző színű embereinkkel licitálunk vagy használunk lapokat. A 4 körös játék már második köre is szinte átláthatatlan lehetőségmennyiséggel operál. Nagyon sok ilyen lap kerül elő és nehezen optimalizálható figuráink jó helyre rakása. Persze minden ér valamit, de szerintem annak ellenére, hogy az első játékunkban nagyon szoros végeredmény született simán elképzelhető nagy vereség is. Szaharaszáraz a játék, semmilyen téma nem jön át, ez full optimalizálás. Megmondom őszintén csak azért nem lep meg e tavalyi esseni játék sikere, mert tudom a fő geekek ilyen játékokra vágynak.

844,"Keyflower is a game of auctions, resource acquisition, end game scoring bonuses and a small spatial element with the tiles you acquire.  There are 4 rounds, with each round being associated with a season.  During each season tiles will be up for auction.  They do have a pattern:  Spring: Resource acquisition tiles Summer: Boats which provide permanent special abilities and tiles which allow you to spend resources to gain more/more valuable resources. Fall: Scoring opportunity tiles by spending or moving resources. Winter: End of game scoring bonuses for resources you save until the end of the game.  The resources come in two main types: Meeples and Non-Meeples (which there are multiple types). The way meeples are used to both activate tiles and bid on tiles is the most interesting part of the game.  The auction and use of tiles are all happening simultaneously in a round.  To elaborate, when you bid or activate a tile you use a meeple/meeples of the same color which locks the tile into that color for counterbids and activations.  Not only can you activate other people's tiles (essentially giving them your meeples) but you can activate tiles that are being bid on (meaning people bid not only on the tile, but the meeples that activated the tiles).    Winter Tiles are also more unique than the other seasons.  At the beginning of the game players are dealt winter tiles.  At the beginning of the 4th round player's secretively and simultaneously choose how many and which tiles they want to add to Winter's auction.  After choosing the tiles, they are shuffled and displayed so people aren't 100% sure who added what tiles to the auction.  The first problem I have is: either you are either forced to specialize in the winter tiles you've been dealt or risk them not being in the game.  This is a minor complaint as the same argument could be leveled at Troyes.  The more troubling issue for me is that in the 2 games I've played, it was almost more important to bid on winter tiles that seem likely to give the player a win than what would benefit you the most.  I would finally caution that you have to be very careful which axis you're flipping your tiles as their orientation matters.  This is a very interesting game that's going to appeal to many people but I didn't quite work for me for the two reasons I mentioned relating to the winter tiles.  Despite not using every tile in every game (increasing the games replay value), I think after repeated plays the game would start to feel samey for me.",True

Interactive, multi dimensional wonderful 'post' Euro design  -------------------  3 plays in and loving it. Fantastic with three players. Huge variability with tile draw - all games have felt very different because of resource priorities/scarcity and scoring options.

What I don't like: Blind action - this is a lottery, guess right and be in the right place in the turn order and you do well. Some people like this sort of thing, I don't (much).  Distribution of heroes - it's (relatively) easy to put yourself as 'most evil' and with the right game play the least - but in the middle its another lottery as to your position. Meaning you might get that priest you really don't want, or you might not ...  I think it only really works with 4, currently not a problem as everyone wants to try it. However once the cult of the new move on to the next shiny release only working for 4 could be a major reason for it not getting played.  And it feels like a missed opportunity too - quite fiddly for actual 'game' - and I'd have much prefered a brain controlling the adventurers raiding your dungeon, say having 2 parts of the game. One where you build a dungeon and another where you build a team of dungeon raiders to go raid an opponent's dungeon.  So as it stands, mixed feelings - really need to play it a bit more to decide if all the minuses outweigh the currently 'it feels so cool' theme.  * Update, played again and I was a little surprised to find the shine was off this totally. I just found it a mix of dull and annoying - I don't really get why this needs a blind selection mechanic at all.  ** Update, now have a copy, so I'll get a chance to play 2 and 3 player games too, rating might change, or it will hit the trade pile!  ** Update - now tried it with 2 and 3 and I've changed my mind, it works fine with both.

Given the length, it's a bit frustrating that luck of the draw (especially with traps and spells, but in other spots, as well) can sometimes tank a lot of careful preparation ... but that can be kinda humorous, as well. A ""7"" rating for now, but that may change. I think if this speeds up to the advertised time of 90 minutes or less with experienced players, it may go up in my ratings. If it continues to veer into two-hour-plus territory, it'll probably head the other way. Update: The set-up length and - even more so - the time and effort requited to teach this game - have relegated it to an unused corner of the game shelf.

The game should be played with 4 players only, though, since any players fewer than 4 are replaced by dummy players whose actions each round are randomly chosen and whose minions are placed on the level 2 action of whichever cards are chosen.

There is some simultaneous action selection (queued like RoboRally), so if you have a strong distaste for that you may not enjoy it, but I didn't find it to be that offensive.  Basically, each player secretly selects 3 actions every turn; usually the first player to select any given action gets the least benefit at a small cost, the second player gets the best deal, the third player pays a lot for a good benefit, and the fourth player gets hosed (though it's rare for all 4 players to select the same action in a given turn).  These actions allow you to gather resources to build up your dungeon and fight off a series of adventurers.  Most of the points at the end of the game revolve around how well you were able to stave off those adventurers, and how impressive your dungeon is overall.

Another worker placement game?  And these are independent dungeons, right?  Why are the costs for some things inflated if you do it?  I guess if you really stretch it, I can see why it would be harder to hire monsters, but it's pretty difficult to justify that everybody can't widen their tunnel system at the same time using the same number of imps.

A good friend/fellow gamer kept good-naturedly hounding me to play this game. ""I hadn't played Le Havre?!"" Nope, largely because I knew this mega-resource 2+ hour conversion game would take some time, and I was probably lazy. Now that I've played it once, I can guess it won't be my favorite, but it's not awful.  Things going against it are the play length and the fact that there's a bit of solitaire play going on. Plus, I tend to enjoy games that offer a harsh system instead of a ""playground"" of options.   However, things going for it are that the resource conversion options are actually fairly thematic. If felt different to pump out fish or bread vs. coal or iron. Although a first play left me ignorant to the various buildings that later emerged, the game offers a nice story arc. And lastly, I dig the fact that on your turn you're basically gobbling resources or choosing a building. The only drawback is the dizzying array of choices (though I'm sure that gets better with familiarity).   Bottom line -- I'd play this again and see if my opinion improves with familiarity.  Update: Check that initial rating. Bump it up to an 8. After playing it the night before, I'm still thinking about it and possible strategies. I'd like to try this as a three player game.  Update: OK, so I played a three player game, and this drops to a 6, where I think it will stay. Between the plays, I played a couple of games of Agricola and Homesteaders.

872,"May 2011:  Complex and headache inducing.  Admirable design and mechanics, but for me, it just leaves me slightly cold thematically. Building buildings and ships once again. Sigh.  August 2013:  After playing this a second time, how I feel about this game is a bit of a mystery to me.  Clearly, it is well-designed and seemingly bursting with thematic elements like coal, iron, fish, cattle, ships and buildings that affect these elements in logical ways.    Yet, surprisingly, this game leaves me feeling so cold and detached thematically.  I really feel like I am merely playing a grinding, repetitive series of mechanics and resource conversions to merely create victory points.  Additionally, I feel very little interaction or competition with the other players.  After two plays, I simply have zero desire to play this game again, so I have to downgrade it to a 6.

The basic mechanism is that you deal and score three independent rounds, with each card type having different scoring rules.  There are two exceptions to the basic mechanism.  Pudding stays out between between rounds and scores at the end of the game.  Chopsticks don't score anything but allow you, on a future turn in the round, to draft two cards instead of one.  When you do that, you put the chopsticks in the hand to keep the hand sizes equal.",True

This creates a wonderful tension of wanting to get your good cards out, but not sharing too much information too soon.  You can play the game two ways... with or without the tactics cards. They add some interesting surprises and a bit more chaos.   My wife and I racked up 10+ plays in a matter of two days. This one is definitely a keeper. ",True

893,"Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a scenario-based dungeon-crawler based in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos.  While there is some combat, the game puts more of an emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving.  The game is fully cooperative and moderated by a mobile app, that provides information about board setup and what happens when you interact with various features and monsters.  However, the app doesn't track everything--skill checks are still performed with physical dice, and the app doesn't store information about characters' locations, damage, or items.  This is nice as players can still make informed decisions about dice risk, and you don't have to keep fiddling with the app to keep it abreast of everything that's going on.  However, the app does know some things about what's going on, such as which rooms have been explored and which items have been inspected, and clearly presents challenges based on that--the app obscures why some of the events are happening, which can be a little unusual for a boardgamer.  Personally, I was pleasantly surprised by the gameplay of this game, as I found the mystery to be very intriguing, and interacting with the world to find out what happens definitely kept my interest.

The actions are intuitive, but, at first, the explanation of the game was scary - there are so much things to be aware of, but even though is necessary to know all of them, they came only one at a time, by the spin of the wheels.  You can gather food and wood; make developments; construct buildings and wonders; pay homage to the Gods; acquire resources - wood, stone, gold, crystal skulls. All of this you can do, and all of them are interconnected and are useful - but you won't be able to use one of the actions in a rinse-and-repeat type of play: you will need food, resources, developments, buildings and appease the Gods.

A végfeltétel siettetése most nem annyira jött ki, mert az egyik játékos annyira elhúzott, hogy tulajgondképpen bármikor végetérhetett volna számára nem volt esélyünk behozni. Most ez a dolog jött ki erősen, hogy már az első két kör után kialakult a játékbeli végsorrend. Bár a többi játékos között azért szorosabb lett a dolog, de akkor is látható volt, hogy nagyon büntet a játék. A másik dolog a gyönyörű térkép nem nagyon segít abban, hogy adott hexa pontosan melyik térképtípushoz tartozik, igaz ebben az elején meg lehet közösen állapodni, hogy később ne legyen belőle vita. Egyértelműen ez a játék tetszik az ugyanolyan típusúak közül a legkevésbé, de nem csökkentek a pontján.",True
965,"A very nice game for introducing people into the wondeful world of board gaming.  Fast, fun, yet still enough strategy to keep a diehard gamer . . . well . . . in the game.

967,"Simple, quick and generally luck based. I can't believe I hadn't gotten this to the table sooner. I need more plays of it, but it's a brilliant filler, especially if you do the half/half variant and just play through the deck once.  Edit: Upon further plays, this game is less luck based than it first lets on. It's still criticized in our group as being luck based and random, yet somehow I tend to win a good percentage of the time. Go figure.",True
968,I like the gameplay among equally skilled players but the scoring is always confusing. How hard is it to print scoring points on the cards that score points? Partner game so if your playing with serious players and violate convention fun will be sucked out.,True
969,"A poker variant that is played in partnership.  The goal is to discard first to score some points.  If you're four, you'll probably play something else, but the game works well enough to give it a try once in a while.",True
970,"Excellent partnership climbing game where taking tricks gets a few points but of primary purpose is really to play out of cards as quickly as possible. However, I find that I am not nearly as enthusiastic about this one as a number of my friends and also find that it is not the quick closer game many people think this is...:-) ",True
971,Interesting trick-taking game.  Has a few similarities to Gang of Four.  Hard to grasp until you've played a few rounds.  I guess it's best played as a partnership game with 4 people.,True
972,"It seems to me that this card game is more dependent upon the luck of the cards than I usually like. Quite often the decisions seem to made for you. I like the game play, but the 200 points straight out for coming first and second is a hefty bonus that seems just too generous to me. Calling Tichu is a gutsy gambling mechanism to set apart the men from the boys. There are some nice quirks to the game and it's fun to play, but it's no Skat or Mü. The luck of the cards isn't really offset by a decent points scoring mechanism - instead it's mostly all or nothing. I prefer to play other card games to this one, but I don't mind it.",True
973,"Roll for the Galaxy replicates Race for the Galaxy almost exactly, except it uses dice instead of cards. Despite the randomness inherent in die rolling, it does seem like Roll is ""easier"" due to the amount of luck mitigation built into the system, something that is not found in Race for the Galaxies card mechanics.  I have heard some people say that you can make a value judgement on the two games based on your preference of difficulty level. I'm not so sure, because this game is quite fun, regardless of the existence of Race for the Galaxy. Personally, I think there is room for both.  ",True
974,"It has the feel of Race for the Galaxy, but it's unquestionably a dice game.  There are several mechanisms for mitigating luck and enough decisions to give a distinct advantage to strategic play. ",True
975,"It's fine.  I think I like Race better, but maybe that's just because I've played more of it.",True
976,"Not quite as enamored with this game after repeated plays. The dice mechanism, while very innovative and interesting at how you are able to mitigate your dice rolls, wears off on its flashiness pretty quickly. I think this game is fine, but it's not a Race For the Galaxy killer. This is really only a better option if you want to play with more than 2 or 3 people, and even then I'd probably still pull out Puerto Rico over this.",True
977,"Missing one 1-vp chip  Pros: Stellar quality components, from the colorful dice, cups, player boards and shields, bags and tiles. Dice are fun to manage. Lots of tactical and strategic decisions to make every turn.  Cons: Open to player cheating due to hidden screen, though used dice must be re-bought and playing with trustworthy people offsets this.  Manipulating the dice in this game is different enough that it stands as its own game next to Race.",True
978,"Many times, the dice version of a game is obviously just a cash grab on the property, with the dice game being some silly little watered down version of the original.  However, with Roll for the Galaxy, it is evident that much thought went into the game to make it stand on it's own legs, which is great to see!  If you're familiar with Race, Roll has almost all familiar ideas, just implemented in a way that makes the game work extremely well with a dice management system as the main engine.  Many aspects of the game have been cleverly streamlined to allow it to work very well and stand alone, while maintaining all of the familiarity of the original.  If you like loads of custom dice that come together for a very good game, and you like Race for the Galaxy, I don't see much reason you wouldn't like this.",True
979,"Ma sikerült kipróbálnom. Nem rossz. Nekem nagyon hasonlít a race for the galaxyra, ami akár pozitívum is lehetne, de a mértéke miatt azt mondanám, hogy nem venném meg mellé. Az kétségtelen nagy előnye a kártyáshoz képest, hogy nem kell ikontengereket megjegyezni, viszont cserébe nyelvfüggő. Menete:: 1. Dobsz egy rakat kockával. 2. Szétosztod őket az rftgnek megfelelően fázisokra, de csak egy olyat választhatsz, ami garantáltan végre lesz hajtva. A többinél bízol a többiekben. 3. Végrehajtjátok a kiválasztott fázisokat, amik kicsit mások: - explore: felépíthető lapkákat (bolygók és fejlesztések) húzol egy zsákból - bolygót építesz (ez kockák rápakolásával megy) - fejlesztést építesz - bolygóra termelsz - bolygóról eladsz pontért vagy pénzért 4. visszavásárolod az elhasznált kockáidat pénzért. Ez érdekes mechanizmus, mert van olyan kör, hogy akár nyolc kockával is dobsz, de olyan is akad, hogy csak eggyel.  A felépített cuccok aztán új kockákat adnak, vagy kockaforgatási lehetőséget, vagy több pontot/pénzt az eladásokért stb.",True
980,"Cute little game about trying to save a failing sub.  Comical nature, with the option to betray everyone and flee the ship make this quite entertaining.  Borrows from Awful Green Things and Jenseuits von Theben, but in good ways.  For the size package, it does pack quite a bit in.  Plays pretty fast as well.",True
981,"Played it 3 times in a row straight out of the box, and still would have been happy to play more, which is a very good sign!  The game plays quickly enough (our games were taking 30 minutes) and has an addictive quality along with variance from game to game that definitely gives it that ""one more time!"" feel.  Just from a rules read, Kingdom Builder might sound pretty boring and a bit simplistic.  However, while it's definitely not a heavy game by any means, the randomized selection of special actions and scoring cards from game to game is a fun puzzle to try to navigate from game to game.  The main complaint I can see people having with this game is that card draws can sometimes end up dictating your game since you only have a hand of 1 card and must play to that terrain type.  I personally didn't mind this, as the special actions and shrewd placement can help to mitigate the luck of the draw.  However, some people are not going to care for this.  Fortunately, the game is very easily house-ruled is it's a problem for you.  The third game we played, we played with a hand of 2 rather than 1, and while I would play either way, some of the players liked the game much better with a hand of two.  Overall, Kingdom Builder is a great mix of simplicity and fun.  You could easily teach it to anyone in less than 5 minutes, but the game play will keep you coming back again and again!",True
982,"Fascinating abstract strategy game for two players. Simply placing stones on a board. One by one. Evolving into a display of pure elegance, amazing depth and sheer beauty. ***** The handicap stones allow opponents of unequal experience/skill to play Go in a more balanced way, which is rare for abstract games. ***** A 9x9 board is ideal to learn the look and feel of the game (Igowin), but playing on the standard 19x19 board is of course much more fun (Many Faces of Go). And nothing beats playing against real opponents! ***** After playing around with the pc games, a few sessions in the local Go club end of 2005 and reading books for more than two years, I finally joined KGS on 20th May 2008 ... and got really hooked. (Note: only KGS plays against real players are logged in my games played - not those against bots; Well, I actually played only once against a bot on KGS - why bother with bots when you can play with real people?) ***** KGS: 22/05/2008: 16kyu; 26/05/2008: 15kyu; 29/05/2008: 14kyu; 23/06/2008: 13kyu; 16/07/2008: 12kyu; 09/09/2008: 11kyu.",True
983,"The board consists of a 19x19 grid. There are stones in 2 colors - 181 black stones and 180 white stones. Players take turns placing stones at intersections on the grid in an attempt to surround and capture opposing stones and wall off ""territories"" on the board that score at the game's end. Because you are always trying to capture stones and secure key points on the board to define your territories - and trying to prevent your opponent from doing the same - there is a fine degree of both offensive and defensive thinking that is needed on every turn. As stone placement flows across the large grid an impressive variety of situations develop. Not only do you have to think both offensively and defensively, you have to react tactically and plan strategically as well. The capture element is fought in localized situations that develop, while you always have in the back of your mind ways to secure territories for the game's end. A rich and rewarding game.",True
984,"In the old Portugese city of Macao, there are 12 turns. Each player first chooses a card to put on their tableau. 6 different colored dice are then rolled, and players choose two of the colored dice: the number of pips on the dice are the number of action cubes in that color the player receives, but that number of turns later, so some planning is required. Players use action cubes to activate cards, use activated cards, take territories, move on the wall (for turn order in choosing cards) or moving ships to sell goods. Some of the cards requirent different colored cubes to activate, and at the end of the game, non activated cards count against you.   There are many things to consider, and I like the game. It might be a great game if it could be shorter. There are many possibilities of tactics that requires more play to uncover.",True
985,"Bought 8 April 2010.  Very good game and much less AP prone than I thought. Took far less time than expected too (around 2 hours with 4 new players) which was a good thing as well. In hindsight I realize we made a lot of bad decisions, you need to plan ahead far more than we did and not just hope the right dice will turn up (which they never do). The dice mechanic is awesome by the way, few resources now or more in the far future, hard choice to make.   All in all a game I'll gladly play again.  Update. Just a bit too long to be really good. Lowered rating from 8 -> 7.",True
